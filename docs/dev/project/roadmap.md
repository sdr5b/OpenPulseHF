# Roadmap

## Scope policy

- Primary goal: build an independent and competing OpenPulse protocol from scratch.
- External/proprietary compatibility modes (for example VARA and PACTOR-4) are secondary and must not proceed without legal review and explicit approval.
- Regulatory compliance (FCC Part 97, CEPT/EU, UK Ofcom) is a hard requirement before any on-air transmission use. See docs/regulatory.md.

---

## Phase 2 — HPX Protocol Completion (Completed)

All Phase 2 items shipped.

### 2.1 — ACK frame taxonomy and rate adaptation ✅ Done
- `AckType` (8 variants), `AckFrame` (5-byte codec, CRC-8/SMBUS, FNV-1a session hash).
- `SpeedLevel` (SL1–SL11), `RateAdapter` state machine; ACK-DOWN floors at SL2; ChirpFallback via 3 consecutive NACKs.
- `Fsk4Plugin` for FSK4-ACK: 4 tones, 100 baud, Hann-windowed, Goertzel demodulator.
- 11 rate adaptation tests; 3 FSK4 loopback tests.

### 2.2 — HPX500 and HPX2300 adaptive profiles ✅ Done
- `QPSK1000` mode added; `Psk8Plugin` for `8PSK500` and `8PSK1000` (Gray-coded, single-carrier).
- `SessionProfile::hpx500()` (SL2=BPSK31 → SL6=QPSK500) and `SessionProfile::hpx2300()` (SL8=QPSK500 → SL11=8PSK1000).
- HPX2300 waveform decision: single-carrier over OFDM (lower PAPR, simpler AFC — see docs/architecture.md).
- 4 session profile tests; 8 adaptive profile integration tests.

### 2.3 — Signed handshake and manifest verification ✅ Done
- `ConReq`/`ConAck` wire frames with Ed25519 sign/verify; trust evaluation via `evaluate_handshake()`.
- `TransferManifest` with SHA-256 payload hash, sender ID, Ed25519 signature; `verify_manifest()`.
- 12 handshake integration tests; 6 manifest integration tests.

### 2.4 — Channel access and shared-channel operation ✅ Done
- `DcdState`: RMS energy threshold, 100 ms hold window, `update()`/`is_busy()`/`energy()`.
- 0.3-persistence CSMA in `stage_emit_output()`; `ModemError::ChannelBusy` on blocked TX.
- 4 CSMA loopback integration tests.

### 2.5 — Peer cache and query subsystem ✅ Done
- `PeerDescriptor`: self-authenticating signed identity; `peer_id` IS the Ed25519 verifying-key bytes.

- Trust-weighted path scoring; `score_route`/`select_best_scored_route`.
- `RelayDataChunk` (msg_type 0x05) and `RelayHopAck` (msg_type 0x06) wire codecs.
- 12 relay integration tests (path scoring, 3-hop chain, event drain, wire round-trips).

### 2.7 — Compression (session layer) ✅ Done
- `lz4_flex 0.11`; `compress_if_smaller()` — compress-then-compare, returns original if LZ4 not smaller.
- `ConReq`/`ConAck` carry `supported_compression`/`selected_compression`; covered by Ed25519 signature. **Superseded by #1166** (in the #1147 wire break): both fields removed — nothing consumed the selection.
- 9 compression integration tests.

---

## Phase 3 — Advanced Signal Processing and Compliance (Partial)

Most Phase 3 items shipped. Remaining: 3.5 on-air validation.

### 3.1 — Post-quantum in-band handshake ✅ Done
- `ml-dsa 0.1.0-rc.9` (ML-DSA-44) and `ml-kem 0.3` (ML-KEM-768) added to `openpulse-core`.
- `PqConReq`/`PqConAck` wire frames with classical + PQ pubkeys, KEM pubkey/ciphertext, dual signatures.
- Hybrid mode: Ed25519 + ML-DSA-44 dual signature; X25519 + ML-KEM-768 dual KEM.
- SAR encode→fragment→reassemble→decode round-trip validated for full PQ payload sizes.
- 12 PQ handshake integration tests.

### 3.2 — Convolutional FEC evaluation ✅ Done
- No pure-Rust Turbo (BCJR/MAP iterative) crate exists; proxy: rate-1/2 convolutional code (K=3, G={7,5} octal) with hard-decision Viterbi decoder.
- `crates/openpulse-core/src/conv.rs`: `ConvCodec` — same interface as `FecCodec` (encode/decode with 4-byte length prefix).
- Benchmark (`crates/openpulse-core/tests/fec_comparison.rs`, 6 tests): at channel BER 0.01 (AWGN), RS post-decode BER = 0.497 vs ConvCodec post-decode BER = 0.0004; CPU overhead 3.8×.
- **Decision: ACCEPTED** — ConvCodec added as an optional alternative FEC for AWGN-dominant paths (e.g., VHF line-of-sight). RS+interleaver remains default for HF burst-error profiles. Result documented in `docs/vara-research.md`.

### 3.3 — GPU acceleration ✅ Done (PR #90)
- `crates/openpulse-gpu`: `GpuContext` (wgpu device + pre-compiled pipelines), WGSL kernels for BPSK modulation, IQ demodulation, and timing offset search.
- `bpsk-plugin` gains optional `gpu` feature; CPU fallback when GPU returns `None`.
- All GPU functions return `Option<T>` to surface failures rather than silently returning empty/zero data.
- GPU-vs-CPU equivalence tests under `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]`.

### 3.4 — ARDOP-compatible TCP interface ✅ Done (PR #91)
- ARDOP-compatible TCP command/data port interface (`crates/openpulse-ardop`).
- Command port (default 8515): ASCII line protocol — VERSION, MYID, LISTEN, CONNECT, DISCONNECT, ABORT, STATE, BUFFER, PTT, CLOSE.
- Data port (default 8516): `u16 BE` length-prefixed binary framing.
- `openpulse-tnc` binary; loopback mode for protocol-level integration tests.
- 8 integration tests covering all major ARDOP commands and data port framing.
- Legal review still required before labelling as "ARDOP-compatible" in public documentation.

### 3.5 — Regulatory on-air validation *(Phase 3.5-substitute shipped)*
Phase 3.5-substitute (sound-loopback channel simulation) is done (PR #89):
- `ChannelSimHarness` wires two `ModemEngine` instances through `openpulse-channel` models.
- 6 channel-loopback integration tests (clean, AWGN 20 dB, Watterson F1/F2, Gilbert-Elliott with/without FEC).
- These replace on-air validation as the CI gate for loopback correctness.

Remaining on-air items (**in active execution as of 2026-06** — see [onair-status.md](../onair-status.md)):
- Conduct on-air tests on IARU-aligned frequencies for each supported bandwidth class.
- Verify station identification behaviour at 10-minute intervals under long sessions.
- Test relay node automatic control point interface.
- Publish compliance test report as a release artefact.

---

## Phase 4 — Ecosystem and Long-term (Active)

**Active phase.** Phase 4.2, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 shipped.

### 4.2 — Observability and automation ✅ Done (PR #92)
- `EngineEvent` broadcast channel in `ModemEngine` — 8 event variants (AFC update, rate change, DCD flip, HPX transition, frame TX/RX, session start/end).
- `engine.subscribe()` returns a `broadcast::Receiver<EngineEvent>` for real-time event consumption.
- `HpxState`, `HpxEvent`, `RateEvent` all derive `Serialize/Deserialize`.
- `openpulse monitor --mode <MODE>` CLI subcommand streams all engine events as NDJSON to stdout; pipeable to `jq` or scripts.
- 7 integration tests in `engine_events.rs` (including DcdChange and AfcUpdate coverage).

### 4.1 — TUI frontend ✅ Done
- New `crates/openpulse-tui` binary crate using ratatui 0.27 + crossterm.
- Background worker thread drives `ModemEngine::receive()` and forwards events to TUI via `std::sync::mpsc`.
- Live panels: HPX state (colour-coded), AFC offset + rate/mode, DCD energy bar (Gauge), scrollable transitions log (last 50).
- Keyboard: `q`/Ctrl+C to quit, `p` to pause updates, `↑↓` to scroll transition log.

### 4.3 — KISS and AX.25 interface ✅ Done
- New `crates/openpulse-kiss` crate with `openpulse-kisstnc` binary.
- KISS frame encode/decode with full byte stuffing (FEND/FESC).
- AX.25 UI frame encode/decode (callsign, SSID, Control=0x03, PID=0xF0).
- TCP listener (default port 8100) using the same `broadcast` + `std::sync::mpsc` bridge pattern as `openpulse-ardop`.
- 0.3-persistence CSMA (Phase 2.4) already in `ModemEngine`; honoured on TX path.
- Target: APRS clients (APRSdroid, PinPoint, Xastir) via KISS over TCP.
- 8 integration tests (KISS codec round-trips, byte stuffing, AX.25 frame round-trip, TCP loopback with multi-frame and special bytes).

### 4.5 — Signal-path testbench GUI ✅ Done
- New `apps/openpulse-testbench` binary crate using egui/eframe 0.29.
- 4-column live signal-path view: TX (clean), Noise channel, Mixed (TX+noise), RX (decoded).
- Per-tap spectrum plot (FFT, dBFS, configurable dB range) and plasma-colourmap waterfall display.
- Toolbar: mode selector (BPSK31–QPSK500), noise model (AWGN/GE/Watterson/QRN/QRM/QSB/Chirp), SNR slider, FEC toggle, RNG seed, dB range sliders.
- Stats bar: runs, OK, fail, BER, last event from the rolling event log.
- Signal thread driven by `bpsk-plugin` / `qpsk-plugin` directly (no full `ModemEngine`); communicates with UI via `Arc<RwLock<TapData>>` and `crossbeam_channel` stop signal.
- All 7 supported channel models wired; `build_channel()` factory from `openpulse-channel`.

### 4.4 — B2F protocol and Winlink gateway integration ✅ Done
- New `crates/openpulse-b2f` pure-protocol library (no tokio, no modem engine dependency).
- Banner encode/decode: `[WL2K-3.0-B2FWINMOR-4.0-XXXXXXXX]` format with FNV-1a session key.
- B2F control frame codec: FC (file check), FS (file select), FF (finished), FQ (quit); CR-terminated ASCII.
- WL2K message header encode/decode (RFC-5322-like, CRLF-terminated; Mid, Date, From, To, Subject, Body, File, Mbo).
- Compression: Gzip (type D) via `flate2`. LZHUF LH5 (type C) was implemented via `oxiarc-lzhuf` and **removed in PR #948** — never wired to a production caller, and its external-Winlink compatibility was unverified and implausible (LH5 vs FBB's Okumura LZHUF are different bitstreams). Inbound Type C proposals are answered `Reject`.
- `B2fSession` state machine: ISS (Information Sending Station) and IRS (Information Receiving Station) roles; Handshake → ProposalExchange → Transfer → Done states; handles ISS-immediate-proposal pattern.
- Pat-client ARDOP compatibility: added GRIDSQUARE, ARQBW, ARQTIMEOUT, CWID, SENDID, PING commands to `openpulse-ardop`; 3 new integration tests (11 total).
- 9 integration tests in `crates/openpulse-b2f/tests/b2f_integration.rs`.

---

## Phase 5 — Integration and Release Readiness (Completed)

All Phase 5 items shipped. On-air regulatory validation (Phase 5.5-reg) is
**in active execution as of 2026-06** (see [onair-status.md](../onair-status.md)); no
hardware gate blocks further development.

### 5.1 — B2F session driver ✅ Done (PR #98)
- `crates/openpulse-b2f-driver`: `B2fDriver`, `DataPort`, `CmdPort`; `run_iss()` / `run_irs()` lifecycle.
- 4 driver integration tests; shared test helpers in `tests/common/mod.rs`.

### 5.2 — LZHUF codec (Type C) ✅ Done (PR #98) → ❌ REMOVED (PR #948)
- Real LH5 via `oxiarc-lzhuf 0.2.7`; 4-byte BE length prefix; 16 MiB decompression cap.
- **Removed:** the codec never had a production caller and its Winlink Type C compatibility was never verified — LHA `LH5` and FBB's Okumura LZHUF are different bitstreams, so it could not have interoperated. Restoring it requires a captured RMS Express / RMS Gateway Type C blob to validate against.
- `B2fSession::accepted_count()` added to drive IRS data-read loop.

### 5.3 — TOML configuration management ✅ Done (PR #102)
- `crates/openpulse-config`: typed schema, `load()`, `init_template()`; CLI precedence over config.
- `openpulse-tnc` and `openpulse-kisstnc` accept clap CLI flags overriding config file.

### 5.4 — End-to-end loopback integration test ✅ Done (PR #100)
- `crates/openpulse-b2f-driver/tests/e2e_loopback.rs`: bidirectional modem relay through `ChannelSimHarness`.
- `e2e_single_message_awgn_20db` and `e2e_multi_message_clean` — no hardware required.

### 5.5 — Direct TCP Winlink CMS gateway ✅ Done
- `crates/openpulse-gateway`: ISS send + IRS receive over a single `TcpStream` to `cms.winlink.org:8772`.
- `gateway_round_trip` unit test: mock CMS TCP server validates full exchange without network access.

### 5.6 — CpalBackend wiring and on-air test plan ✅ Done (PR #105)
- `AudioConfig` in `openpulse-config`; `--backend` CLI flag; cpal feature gate.
- `docs/on-air_testplan.md`: hardware prereqs, test matrix, regulatory checklist, diagnostics table.

### 5.7 — Testbench live audio capture ✅ Done (PR #108)
- `AudioSource` enum (`Synthetic` / `LiveCapture`); `run_live()` opens system input at 8 kHz mono.
- Source combo disabled while running; panel labels reflect live mode.

### 5.5-reg — On-air regulatory validation *(in active execution, 2026-06 — see [onair-status.md](../onair-status.md))*
Conduct on-air tests on IARU-aligned frequencies, verify station ID at 10-minute intervals,
test relay automatic control point interface, publish compliance report as release artefact.

---

## Phase 6 — AFC, Interoperability, and Network ✅ Done

### 6.1 — AFC correction loop ✅ Done (PR #116)

Close the automatic frequency control feedback path.  The IQ-squaring estimator
(`estimate_frequency_offset` / `afc_estimate_hz`) already runs after every receive call
and its result is exposed via `ModemEngine::last_afc_offset_hz()`.  What is missing is
the correction step.

- Add `afc_correction_hz: f32` field to `ModemEngine`; accumulated from `last_afc_offset_hz`
  with a configurable step size (default 0.1 × estimated offset per frame — slow loop).
- Pass corrected carrier frequency `fc + afc_correction_hz` into each demodulate call.
- Expose `enable_afc()`, `disable_afc()`, `reset_afc()`, `set_center_frequency()` on `ModemEngine`; default enabled.
- `AfcUpdate` event extended with `correction_hz` field so TUI and NDJSON consumers see both
  the residual estimate and the accumulated correction; `#[serde(default)]` for backward compat.
- Integration tests: loopback with a 15 Hz TX/RX carrier offset; asserts AFC converges to
  within ±2 Hz within 25 frames at BPSK100.

### 6.2 — pat / Winlink interoperability ✅ Done (PR #118)

Verify an end-to-end Winlink round-trip driven by `pat` connecting to `openpulse-tnc` via
its ARDOP interface.

- Document and fix any wire-level incompatibilities found during `pat connect` against the TNC.
- Add `FECSEND` and `FECRCV` ARDOP commands (used by pat for FEC-framed transfers).
- Verify `BUFFER` polling behaviour matches pat's expectations during TX drain.
- Packaging: produce a reproducible `.deb` for Raspberry Pi OS (aarch64) and a static
  Linux x86-64 binary; both published as GitHub release assets.
- Acceptance: `pat` can send a message via `openpulse-tnc` and retrieve it back without
  any manual intervention beyond normal `pat` UI operation.

### 6.3 — Network mesh layer ✅ Done (PR #120)

Promote the relay, peer-cache, and query-propagation modules from library code to a running
network service.

- New binary `openpulse-mesh` (or `openpulse-node`) that runs the full HPX relay stack as
  a daemon: peer discovery beacons, query forwarding, store-and-forward relay.
- `CONNECT_MESH` extension to the ARDOP command port: directs `ModemEngine` to enter mesh
  mode, accepting relay frames alongside direct-addressed frames.
- Config: `[mesh]` section in `config.toml` — `enabled`, `max_hops`, `relay_policy`
  (trust-level minimum), `store_forward_ttl_s`.
- Integration tests: 3-node loopback mesh (`ChannelSimHarness` × 2 hops); verify
  a frame addressed to node C arrives via relay through B from A.

### 6.4 — Peer cache wired into mesh daemon ✅ Done (PR #121)

Wire `PeerCache` into `MeshDaemon` so beacon responses populate the local peer table and
nodes can answer peer-query requests from their cached knowledge.

- `MeshDaemon` gains a `PeerCache` field (capacity and TTL from `[mesh]` config).
- Self-seeded at construction so every node always includes itself in query responses.
- `WireMsgType::PeerQueryRequest` dispatch: query local cache, broadcast
  `PeerQueryResponse`, then propagate the request for multi-hop discovery.
- `WireMsgType::PeerQueryResponse` dispatch: upsert results into cache; emit
  `MeshEvent::PeerDiscovered` for new entries; `route_quality` derived from
  `envelope.hop_index`.
- New `MeshEvent` variants: `PeerQueried` and `PeerDiscovered`.
- Integration test: `peer_discovery_via_beacon` — A beacons → B responds with self →
  A caches B and emits `PeerDiscovered`.

---

## Phase 7 — Operator Panel and Dual-Rig Control

### 7.1 — Hamlib full CAT control (`openpulse-radio` extension) ✅ Done

Extend `openpulse-radio` beyond PTT to full rig CAT control via the existing `rigctld`
TCP interface.  The existing `RigctldPtt` already holds a TCP connection; this task
promotes it to a general-purpose `RigctldController`.

**New API surface (`openpulse-radio`)**
- `RigctldController`: wraps a `TcpStream` to `rigctld`; exposes:
  - `set_frequency(hz: u64)` / `get_frequency() -> u64`
  - `set_mode(mode: RigMode)` / `get_mode() -> RigMode`  (`RigMode` enum: USB, LSB, FM, AM, CW, …)
  - `get_signal_strength() -> i32` — S-meter reading in dBm
  - `get_power_out() -> f32` — forward power in watts
  - `get_alc() -> f32` — ALC level (0.0–1.0)
  - `get_swr() -> f32` — SWR reading
  - `ptt_on()` / `ptt_off()` — replaces `RigctldPtt`
- All methods return `Result<T, RadioError>`; `RadioError` gains a `RigctldIo` variant.
- `[radio]` TOML section: `rigctld_addr` (default `"127.0.0.1:4532"`); no breaking change
  to existing PTT-only config.

**Integration tests** (`crates/openpulse-radio/tests/rigctld_integration.rs`):
- Mock `rigctld` TCP server responding to `\get_freq`, `\set_freq`, `\get_level STRENGTH`, etc.
- Round-trip: set frequency → read back; set mode → read back; S-meter parse.

**Dependencies**: none (rigctld TCP protocol is already understood from `RigctldPtt`).

---

### 7.2 — Dual-rig support and cross-band repeater ✅ Done

Add support for a second transceiver and wire both into a cross-band repeater mode.

**Config**

```toml
[radio.rig_a]
rigctld_addr = "127.0.0.1:4532"   # primary rig (RX/TX for normal operation)

[radio.rig_b]
rigctld_addr = "127.0.0.1:4533"   # secondary rig (TX for cross-band repeater)

**New crate: `openpulse-repeater`** (or module in `openpulse-mesh`):
- `CrossBandRepeater`: holds two `RigctldController` instances and two `ModemEngine`
  instances (one per audio device); configurable from `[repeater]` TOML section.
- PTT sequencing: `rig_b.ptt_on()` before TX, `rig_b.ptt_off()` after; configurable
last_updated: 2026-07-17
- `[repeater] enabled = false` — opt-in; disabled by default.
- Operator must configure both rigs and TOML explicitly; no auto-activation.

**Integration tests**: loopback cross-band relay — two `LoopbackBackend` + mock
`rigctld` servers; verify decoded frame on rig_a is re-transmitted on rig_b.

**Dependencies**: Phase 7.1 (`RigctldController`).

---

### 7.3 — Daemon control protocol ✅ Done

Add a structured NDJSON-over-TCP control port to the server daemon, enabling a thin
client (Phase 7.4) to display real-time status and send operator commands.

**Why NDJSON, not protobuf**: `EngineEvent`, `HpxState`, and `RateEvent` already
derive `serde::Serialize/Deserialize` and are streamed as NDJSON by `openpulse monitor`.
The control port is an extension of that existing stream.  Protobuf would require
maintaining a parallel `.proto` schema alongside the Rust type system with no benefit on
a local control channel; it also adds a `protoc` build-time dependency that complicates
cross-compilation to aarch64.  If a future web client materialises, NDJSON over WebSocket
requires no protocol change.

**Protocol** (newline-delimited JSON over TCP, default port 9000):

*Server → client* (event stream, unsolicited):
```json
{"type": "EngineEvent", "event": { ... }}           // existing EngineEvent variants
{"type": "Metrics", "effective_bps": 245, "ecc_rate": 0.03, "compress_ratio": 1.8,
 "afc_correction_hz": -3.2, "signal_strength_dbm": -87}
{"type": "RigStatus", "rig": "a", "freq_hz": 14074000, "mode": "USB",
 "power_w": 50.0, "alc": 0.12, "swr": 1.4}
```

*Client → server* (request/response, each on one line):
```json
{"cmd": "set_mode",    "mode": "BPSK250"}
{"cmd": "set_freq",    "rig": "a", "freq_hz": 14074000}
{"cmd": "accept_qsy",  "token": "abc123"}
{"cmd": "reject_qsy",  "token": "abc123"}
{"cmd": "enable_repeater"}
{"cmd": "disable_repeater"}
```

Server responds with `{"ok": true}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` on the same
connection.

**New crate: `openpulse-server`** (thin binary; library lives in `openpulse-daemon`):
- Wraps the modem engine, ARDOP bridge, KISS bridge, and mesh daemon into one process.
- Spawns the control port listener alongside the existing service ports.
- `Metrics` events emitted on a timer (default 1 Hz) from a background task reading
  `engine.last_afc_offset_hz()`, `engine.dcd_energy()`, and session stats.
- `RigStatus` events emitted at 2 Hz when rig CAT is configured.

**Integration tests** (`tests/control_port.rs`):
- Connect TCP client, verify `EngineEvent` stream flows.
- Send `set_mode` command; verify engine mode changes.
- Send `set_freq`; verify mock rigctld receives the frequency command.

**Dependencies**: Phase 7.1 (rig status), Phase 4.2 (EngineEvent already exists).

---

### 7.4 — `openpulse-panel` operator UI ✅ Done

A native egui desktop application that connects to the `openpulse-server` control port
and provides the full operator experience.

**Layout** (four-region egui window):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Rig A: 14.074 MHz USB  50W  SWR 1.4  [QSY ▼]  │  ← rig status bar
│  Rig B: 145.500 MHz FM  25W  SWR 1.2  [XBAND]  │
├────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┤
│  Waterfall / FFT   │  Session status             │
│  (egui_plot line)  │  Mode:     BPSK250          │
│                    │  Speed:    SL5 / 245 bps    │
│                    │  ECC:      3.1 %            │
│                    │  Compress: 1.8×             │
│                    │  AFC:      −3.2 Hz          │
│                    │  DCD:      ████░░  −92 dBm  │
├────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┤
│  Event log (scrollable, last 100 events)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Controls**: mode selector combo, connect/disconnect button, repeater toggle, QSY
accept/reject buttons (appear only when a QSY proposal is pending), server address field.

**Waterfall**: `egui_plot` line plot of the last FFT snapshot from `Metrics` events;
plasma colourmap waterfall texture (same approach as `openpulse-testbench`).

**Connection model**: panel connects to `HOST:9000` (default `127.0.0.1:9000`);
reconnects automatically on drop; server address editable in the toolbar.

**Dependencies**: Phase 7.3 (control protocol), `egui`/`eframe` (already in workspace).

---

### 7.5 — Signed remote rig control (over-the-air) ✅ Done

Allow a trusted peer to send signed rig-control commands over the air, enabling remote
operation of the second transceiver without an internet link.

**Wire format**: new `WireMsgType::RigCtrlCmd` (msg_type 0x09) carrying a CBOR/JSON
payload signed with the sender's Ed25519 key:
```json
{"cmd": "set_freq", "rig": "b", "freq_hz": 14074000, "ts_ms": 1234567890}
```
Signature covers `cmd + rig + freq_hz + ts_ms`; replay window 30 s.

**Trust policy**: `[remote_control] allow_trustlevels = ["verified"]`; Reduced and Unknown
peers are always rejected; operator must opt in explicitly.

**Acceptance**: `MeshDaemon` dispatches `RigCtrlCmd` frames to a new
`RemoteControlHandler` that validates the signature, checks trust level, enforces the
replay window, and calls `RigctldController` if all checks pass.

**Integration tests**: signed command accepted from Verified peer; rejected from Unknown
peer; replayed command rejected; tampered signature rejected.

**Dependencies**: Phase 7.1 (rig controller), Phase 7.2 (dual-rig), Phase 6.3 (mesh
daemon dispatch), Phase 2.3 (Ed25519 signing infrastructure).

### 7.6 — Full-duplex mode ✅ Done (PR #154)

Full-duplex cross-band repeater implemented. `run_full_duplex(stop)` asserts PTT once and
holds it for the session duration; `relay_one_frame()` skips per-frame PTT cycling when
`full_duplex=true`. PTT is guaranteed to release on error or stop. Config field
`[repeater] full_duplex = false` (default). 3 integration tests added.

## Phase 8 — Waveform Compliance and Pulse-Shaping Expansion

*Unlocked by the bandwidth audit that identified QPSK1000 and 8PSK1000 as exceeding the
2700 Hz HF channel-width limit used by IARU, FCC Part 97, and most national regulations.
Items 8.1 and 8.2 are naming/profile changes; 8.3 is a DSP change that closes the
underlying issue.*

### 8.1 — Rename wideband HPX profiles for non-HF use ✅ Done

The current `hpx2300()` profile reaches SL9=QPSK1000 and SL11=8PSK1000, both of which
occupy ~4000 Hz null-to-null bandwidth with Hann windowing.  These modes are illegal on
HF amateur allocations (2700 Hz hard ceiling) but are legitimate on FM, satellite, and
UHF/VHF links.  The rename makes the operating context explicit.

- Rename `SessionProfile::hpx2300()` → `SessionProfile::hpx_wideband()` in
  `crates/openpulse-core/src/profile.rs`.
- Update all call sites (testbench, testmatrix, integration tests, CLI).
- Add doc comment: *"Wideband profile (≤ 4000 Hz). Legal on FM, satellite, and
  UHF/VHF; exceeds 2700 Hz HF limit at SL9–SL11. Use `hpx_hf()` for HF operation."*
- No wire-protocol change; profile names are local to the session initialisation API.

**Acceptance**: `cargo test --workspace --no-default-features` passes; testbench and
testmatrix compile with the renamed symbol.

---

### 8.2 — HF-compliant capped adaptive profile (`hpx_hf`) ✅ Done

Add a new `SessionProfile::hpx_hf()` profile whose top speed level stays within the
2700 Hz HF channel-width limit.  Bandwidth budget: `4 × Rs ≤ 2700 Hz → Rs ≤ 675 baud`.

| Speed level | Mode | Gross bps | BW (Hann null-to-null) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SL2 (initial) | BPSK31 | 31 bps | 125 Hz |
| SL3 | BPSK63 | 63 bps | 250 Hz |
| SL4 | BPSK250 | 250 bps | 1000 Hz |
| SL5 | QPSK250 | 500 bps | 1000 Hz |
| SL6 (ceiling) | QPSK500 | 1000 bps | 2000 Hz |
| SL7 (ceiling alt) | 8PSK500 | 1500 bps | 2000 Hz |

`hpx_hf()` peaks at SL7 = 8PSK500 (1500 bps gross, 2000 Hz BW).  This is the
HF-legal upper limit with the current Hann-window pulse shaping.

- Implement `SessionProfile::hpx_hf()` in `profile.rs`.
- Add `Tier::Quick` testmatrix cases for the new profile.
- Document in `docs/architecture.md` alongside the existing profile table.
- Update testbench adaptive use-case to expose `HPX-HF` as a named profile choice.

**Acceptance**: adaptive profile integration tests pass for the new profile; testmatrix
quick tier includes at least one HPX-HF × AWGN 20 dB case.

**Dependencies**: none (profile is a pure data change; no new plugins required).

---

### 8.3 — PSK31-style cosine amplitude shaping ✅ Done

PSK31 achieves bandwidth ≈ symbol rate (vs. 4 × Rs for Hann isolated bursts) by applying
a continuous overlapping cosine amplitude envelope across symbol boundaries.  Phase
transitions occur at the zero-crossings of the amplitude, so adjacent symbols fade
smoothly through zero — eliminating the spectral splatter of hard transitions.

Applying this to QPSK1000 reduces its null-to-null bandwidth from ~4000 Hz to ~2000 Hz,
making it legal on HF.  This is a TX-only pulse-shaping change; the existing
Goertzel/IQ-integration receiver does not need modification.

**Implementation**:
- Add `PulseShape` enum to `openpulse-core`: `Hann` (current), `CosineOverlap`.
- `CosineOverlap`: the amplitude envelope for symbol *n* is a half-cosine centred at
  the symbol's midpoint; adjacent symbols share the rising/falling edge so the combined
  envelope is continuous and never drops to zero between symbols (no inter-symbol gap).
- Expose `PulseShape` via `ModulationConfig`; plugins use it in the modulate path;
  default remains `Hann` for backward compatibility.
- Add `"QPSK1000-HF"`, `"8PSK1000-HF"` mode aliases that select `CosineOverlap` with
  the appropriate baud rate, documented as the HF-safe variants of QPSK1000/8PSK1000.
- Update testbench `gross_bps` / `mode_symbol_rate_hz` tables for the new aliases.
- Testmatrix quick tier: add QPSK1000-HF × clean and AWGN 20 dB cases.
- Measure the actual null-to-null bandwidth of QPSK1000-HF in the testbench and confirm
  it falls within 2700 Hz before marking done.

**What this does NOT do**: it does not implement a matched receiver filter or timing
recovery loop.  The receiver integrates over the full symbol period; the overlapping
envelope causes a mild SNR penalty (~1–2 dB) relative to a true matched filter, but
no ISI if the channel delay spread is short relative to the symbol period (acceptable
on HF for 500 baud; marginal at 1000 baud — see FF-3 for the full solution).

**Acceptance**: QPSK1000-HF spectrum in the testbench shows null-to-null BW ≤ 2700 Hz;
loopback round-trip passes on clean channel and AWGN 20 dB.

**Dependencies**: none beyond existing plugin infrastructure.

---

## Phase 9 — Diagnostics and Protocol Intelligence

*Inspired by analysis of FreeDV GUI (scatter plot, SNR trending, TX limiter) and
Mercury/Mercury-Qt (asymmetric rate adaptation, SNR-driven gear-shifting).  All items
are self-contained additions to existing subsystems; none require new crates.*

---

### 9.1 — Constellation / scatter plot in testbench ✅ Done (PR #138)

Add an IQ scatter plot panel to `apps/openpulse-testbench` alongside the existing
spectrum and waterfall views.

**Motivation**: FreeDV's scatter diagram is its most-used demodulation quality indicator.
The `-RRC` modes (FF-3) produce a clean QPSK or 8PSK IQ constellation at the matched-
filter output; the scatter plot makes ISI, phase noise, and timing jitter immediately
visible without needing to interpret BER numbers.

**Implementation**:
- Extend `TapData` with a `recent_symbols: VecDeque<(f32, f32)>` ring buffer (capacity
  ~2000 IQ pairs, ~10 s of symbols at 250 baud).
- Signal thread appends the raw IQ sample at the final decision point for each decoded
  symbol before the threshold comparison.  For `-RRC` modes this is after the matched
  filter and Gardner timing recovery; for Hann/CosineOverlap modes it is the integrated
  IQ pair.
- New `draw_scatter_panel()` in `apps/openpulse-testbench/src/ui.rs`: renders an
  `egui_plot::Points` scatter with a colour gradient fading from yellow (recent) to dark
  blue (oldest), matching FreeDV's visual idiom.  Panel height matches `SPECTRUM_H`
  (170 px); placed to the right of the spectrum plot in each tap column.
- No new dependencies; `egui_plot` is already in the workspace.

**Acceptance**: constellation is visible in the testbench for QPSK500-RRC on a clean
channel showing four tight clusters; on Watterson Good F1 the clusters visibly broaden.

**Dependencies**: Phase 4.5 (testbench), FF-3 (RRC modes produce cleaner constellation).

---

### 9.2 — Asymmetric per-direction rate adaptation ✅ Done (PR #138)

Mercury's most differentiating protocol feature: the A→B and B→A paths each select
their own speed level independently, since SNR is rarely symmetric on HF.

**Current state**: `RateAdapter` is stateless per-direction — it applies ACK feedback to
a single shared `SpeedLevel`.  When node A sends at SL8 but the A→B path is marginal,
NACKs force both directions down even though B→A may be excellent.

**Implementation**:
- Add `tx_level: SpeedLevel` and `rx_level: SpeedLevel` fields to `RateAdapter` (or
  create `BiDirRateAdapter` wrapping two independent `RateAdapter` instances).
- `apply_ack()` updates only `tx_level` (our outgoing path quality as reported by the
  peer); a new `apply_remote_ack(ack: AckType)` updates `rx_level` when the peer's ACK
  includes a reverse-direction quality report.
- Extend `AckFrame` with a `reverse_ack: AckType` field (the sender's assessment of the
  *incoming* path quality). **Corrected 2026-08-28 (#1165): there is no version nibble
  in the frame header** — this line claimed one, and the plan it describes was already
  built on a different mechanism. `reverse_ack` is 3 bits in byte 3, announced by a
  presence flag at byte 0 bit 3, and it is those **presence-flag bits** that carry the
  compatibility, not a version field. It is also not "1-byte": the frame is a fixed 5
  bytes and has never grown. What version headroom exists is byte 0 bits 7:5, which
  #1165 made enforceable by rejecting non-zero rather than ignoring them.
- `ModemEngine::current_adaptive_mode()` returns `(tx_mode, rx_mode)` as a tuple;
  callers that assumed symmetric modes need updating.
- `RigStatus` and `EngineEvent::RateChange` gain an optional `direction` field.

**Acceptance**: integration test: two `ChannelSimHarness` engines with different SNR in
each direction converge to different speed levels per direction within 30 frames.

**Dependencies**: Phase 2.1 (`RateAdapter`, `AckFrame`), Phase 4.2 (`EngineEvent`).

---

### 9.3 — SNR trend plot in testbench ✅ Done (PR #138)

Add a rolling SNR history chart to the testbench stats panel, inspired by FreeDV's
180-second SNR plot.

**Implementation**:
- Add `snr_history: VecDeque<(f64 /*timestamp*/, f32 /*snr_db*/)>` (capacity 1800
  samples = 180 s at 10 Hz update) to `AppStats`.
- Signal thread estimates per-frame SNR as `signal_power / noise_power` where
  `noise_power` is sampled from the `channel.generate_noise()` RMS; emits to stats ring.
- New `draw_snr_plot()` renders an `egui_plot::Line` showing SNR (dBFS) vs. time
  (seconds ago); x-axis inverted so newest is on the right.  Range: −10 to +35 dB.
  Placed below the existing stats bar.
- Stats bar gains a live `SNR: XX.X dB` label updated at the same 10 Hz cadence.

**Acceptance**: SNR plot is visible in the testbench; SNR drops visibly when noise model
is switched from Clean to AWGN 10 dB.

**Dependencies**: Phase 4.5 (testbench).

---

### 9.4 — SNR as secondary rate adapter input ✅ Done (PR #138)

Supplement ACK-only rate decisions with a raw SNR estimate, closing the feedback loop
faster on rapidly degrading channels (Mercury's "hybrid SNR + delivery-feedback").

**Current state**: `RateAdapter::apply_ack()` only acts on `AckType`; it cannot react
until a full frame has been sent and acknowledged.  On a channel that drops 3 dB in a
single propagation skip, the engine sends several frames at the wrong rate before the
NACKs arrive.

**Implementation**:
- Add `apply_snr_hint(snr_db: f32)` to `RateAdapter`; called after every receive frame
  (SNR derived from the modem's `estimate_afc_hz` signal-strength side-channel or a
  separate RMS estimator in `ModemEngine`).
- If `snr_db` drops below `profile.snr_floor_for_level(current_level)` (a per-level
  SNR threshold table added to `SessionProfile`), immediately step down one level without
  waiting for a NACK.  If `snr_db` rises above `snr_ceiling_for_level`, candidate an
  upgrade (confirmed only after the next ACK-UP).
- Thresholds are conservative (3 dB headroom above the Eb/N₀ required for 10⁻³ BER at
  each modulation order) so the SNR hint only acts in unambiguous cases; normal ACK
  feedback remains the primary driver.
- `RateChange` engine event gains an optional `trigger: RateTrigger` field
  (`AckUp`, `AckDown`, `NackDecrement`, `ChirpFallback`, `SnrFloor`, `SnrCeiling`).

**Acceptance**: integration test: engine running at SL8 on a clean channel; inject a
large noise burst (SNR drops below SL8 floor); assert engine steps down within 3 frames
before any NACK has been processed.

**Dependencies**: Phase 2.1 (`RateAdapter`), Phase 9.2 (asymmetric adaptation; shares
the `SessionProfile` SNR threshold table).

---

### 9.5 — Broadcast / beacon mode alongside ARQ ✅ Done (PR #139)

Mercury runs a broadcast mode in parallel to its ARQ sessions, enabling one-to-many
unacknowledged transmissions (beacons, network announcements, position reports).

**Implementation**:
- New `WireMsgType::BroadcastFrame` (msg_type 0x0A): fixed 4-byte header
  `(callsign_hash: u32, seq: u16, ttl: u8, flags: u8)` followed by variable payload.
  No ACK expected; no session state required.
- `ModemEngine::broadcast(payload: &[u8])` — encodes a `BroadcastFrame`, skips CSMA
  persistence check (broadcasts are short; sender takes responsibility), and transmits
  immediately.
- `MeshDaemon` re-broadcasts received `BroadcastFrame`s with `ttl -= 1` until `ttl == 0`
  (store-and-forward propagation limited to TTL hops).
- `openpulse-cli broadcast --payload <hex|text> --ttl <n>` subcommand.
- Beacon mode: `openpulse-cli beacon --interval 600s --callsign KX0ABC` sends a minimal
  `BroadcastFrame` every interval (station ID compliance for long sessions).

**Acceptance**: two `ChannelSimHarness` nodes: node A broadcasts; node B receives and
emits `EngineEvent::FrameRx`; relay node C re-broadcasts with `ttl - 1`.

**Dependencies**: Phase 2.4 (CSMA/DCD), Phase 6.3 (mesh daemon for multi-hop relay).

## Phase 10 — Receiver-led OTA adaptation and twin-station validation (2026-06)

Over-the-air adaptive rate-stepping wired end to end through the daemon, plus a
full-stack, hardware-free validation rig and its real-radio scenario. This closes
the long-deferred "adaptive rate-stepping over the air (RX lockstep)" item.

### 10.1 — Receiver-led OTA rate-stepping ✅ Done
- `openpulse-core::ota_rate::OtaRateController` — per-direction lockstep: the data
  receiver leads, shipping an **absolute** `recommended_level` in the ACK; the
  sender follows. Lockstep invariant: the receiver advances at most one mapped
  step above the highest level it actually decoded, so a lost ACK never desyncs
  (PRs #489, #490).
- `AckFrame.recommended_level` packed into free bits; `SpeedLevel::as_u8/from_u8/name/from_name`.
- Engine: `start_ota_session`/`respond_arq_ota`/`apply_ota_ack`/`transmit_arq_ota`;
  AFC-isolated 2-mode candidate fallback; MODCOD profile `hpx_modcod` with per-level FEC.
- Operator controls (#492): level bounds, lock/unlock, A2 backlog gate, A3 re-upgrade hold.
- M2M4 RX SNR estimator (#494) + silence VAD gating (#499) replacing the weak LLR proxy.

### 10.2 — Daemon OTA wiring ✅ Done
- Config `[modem] ota_*`; control protocol `StartOtaSession`/`StopOtaSession`/
  `OtaSetLevelBounds`/`OtaLockLevel`/`OtaUnlock`/`OtaSetHysteresis` + `OtaStatus`
  events; CLI `openpulse daemon ota-*`; panel toolbar OTA line + lock (#495–#500, #497).
- RX tick routes to `poll_ota_rx` (idle-gated, PTT-sequenced ACK) when a session
  is active; `SendMessage` drives `transmit_arq_ota_within` with the real-radio
  **ISS PTT turnaround** (key TX → release → listen for ACK) so the ladder steps
  under traffic (#501, #512, #513).
- Aggressiveness preset (`conservative`/`balanced`/`aggressive`) bundling the
  A2/A3 hysteresis gates into one operator control — config `[modem]
  ota_aggressiveness`, `OtaSetAggressiveness` command, CLI (#517).

### 10.3 — Twin-station validation rig ✅ Done
- `server::run` extracted from the binary with an injectable audio backend (#507).
- `openpulse_daemon::twin::spawn_bridged_pair` — two REAL daemons bridged through a
  channel model in one process; `LoopbackBackend::new_split()` (no self-loop);
  headless deterministic test + `examples/twin_station.rs` (#508).
- Real-audio substrate: `[audio] device` + `ModemEngine::set_default_device`;
  `scripts/setup-twin-loopback.sh` + `run-twin-station-audio.sh` (snd-aloop) (#509).
- `scripts/twin-traffic.sh` random-data traffic generator (#510).
- Spectrum-tap fix: the daemon now feeds real audio to the spectrum broadcast, so
  panels show live spectrum/waterfall instead of an FFT of silence (#511).
- `apps/openpulse-twinview` — combined both-directions viewer over two daemons (#514).

### 10.4 — Engine AGC (data-aided) ✅ Done
- 64QAM corner-preamble data-aided AGC for input-level robustness (no-op at unity
  level); the streaming `dsp::Agc` PSK-ladder rollout remains a follow-on (#503).

### 10.5 — On-air twin-OTA scenario ✅ Done (operator-run)
- `docs/config/onair-twin-ota.example.sh` + `scripts/run-onair-twin-ota.sh` +
  runbook `docs/dev/onair-twin-ota.md`: two real daemons over rigctld CAT+PTT and
  cpal, OTA rate-stepping over the air, observed in `openpulse-twinview` (#515).
  On-air execution is the operator's step (no radios/cpal in CI).

### 10.7 — Live-audio operability hardening ✅ Done
- Burst capture: the daemon RX tick now accumulates audio across ticks while a
  carrier is present and decodes the whole burst on carrier-drop
  (`ModemEngine::capture_burst` + `decode_burst`/`ota_decode_burst`), so a frame
  spanning many tick windows on a streaming cpal backend is assembled correctly
  (the in-process bridge delivered frames atomically and hid this) (#518).
- DCD squelch exposed: `[modem] dcd_squelch` default + `[modem.dcd_squelch_bands]`
  per-band map, resolved on retune via `bandplan::band_label_for_hz`, plus a
  `SetDcdSquelch` runtime command/CLI — so a band's noise floor doesn't read as a
  permanent carrier and stall the burst flush (#519).

### 10.8 — CE-SSB TX envelope conditioning ✅ Done
- Controlled-Envelope SSB conditioner (Hershberger W9GR, QEX 2014; public domain):
  `openpulse_dsp::cessb` look-ahead peak-stretcher raises average TX power at fixed
  PEP without overshoot. Prototyped + measured in channel-sim (#521):
  **OFDM52 +1.6/+2.7/+3.8 dB at 2.5/2.0/1.5×rms clip, ZERO BER cost**; ~0 dB and real
  EVM on single-carrier 64QAM; 0 dB on near-constant-envelope BPSK.
- Wired as an optional, **default-on, per-mode** TX conditioner gated to high-PAPR
  multicarrier (`cessb_benefits`: OFDM*/SCFDMA* only; no-op elsewhere): applied in
  `stage_emit_output` after attenuation, before the tanh limiter, with a peak-restore
  rescale. `[modem] cessb_enabled` config, `ControlCommand::SetCessb` + `openpulse
  daemon set-cessb` CLI, panel "CE-SSB: ON/OFF" toolbar toggle (#522, #523).
- OFDM-HOM gate — **this conclusion was later REVERSED; see the note below.** As recorded at the
  time: the dense-subcarrier variants `OFDM52-{8PSK,16QAM,32QAM,64QAM}` stay high-PAPR multicarrier,
  so the average-power gain holds (unlike single-carrier QAM, ~0 dB); they add a small EVM cost
  pure-QPSK OFDM does not (raw BER ≈ 0.0007–0.0039 at the 2.0×rms operating point) that was judged
  FEC-absorbable, so `cessb_benefits` enabling all OFDM*/SCFDMA* was held correct as-is.
  **Reversal:** that judgement rested on a *raw BER* reading — the repo's own "an uncoded-BER win is
  not a win" rule, applied in the wrong direction. The coded path collapses (OFDM52-32QAM 0/20,
  -64QAM 3/20; SCFDMA52-32/64QAM 5/30, versus ≥20/20 with CE-SSB off), so the gate was narrowed to
  QPSK-subcarrier OFDM only and the test renamed accordingly:
  `cessb_benefits_hold_on_low_order_ofdm_hom` in `tests/cessb_power_evm.rs`.
- Verification note: virtual/channel-sim covers decode integrity. The average-power
  gain at fixed PEP is a PA-domain effect no audio loopback can show — **now confirmed
  on real RF** (rpi53 + FT-991A, 20 W via a 20 dB/20 W attenuator on 144.6 MHz):
  interleaved OFF/ON A/B of gapless OFDM52 measured **+1.18 dB** average-power gain on
  the rig's PO meter, matching the channel-sim prediction (+1.2 dB for this payload at
  the 2.0×rms operating point), with ALC unchanged between ON/OFF (gain at equal peak
  = the CE-SSB signature).
- Spectral regrowth — **conditioner DSP part DONE in software** (`cessb_acpr_spectral_regrowth`
  in `tests/cessb_power_evm.rs`): Welch PSD of CE-SSB on vs off OFDM52 shows the
  conditioner is spectrally benign at the 2.0×rms operating ratio (out-of-band
  regrowth −0.46 dB, no 99% OBW widening, shoulder −0.85 dB), self-validated against a
  naive hard clip that splatters clearly more (+5 dB OOB, OBW 2133→3094 Hz).
- PA-compression spectral mask — **DONE on real RF** (SDRplay RSP2pro, off-air capture
  of the FT-991A's 144.6 MHz OFDM52, CE-SSB OFF/ON A/B, 3 bursts each at 20 W).
  **CE-SSB ON does not worsen the spectral mask**: ACPR lower Δ−1.0 dB (cleaner), upper
  Δ−0.1 dB, 99% OBW Δ−46 Hz — all negligible/benign. Front-end linearity validated
  across a 32 dB level change (shoulders-dBc constant ⇒ real TX, not SDR IMD). With the
  +1.18 dB average-power gain, this confirms on QPSK OFDM **CE-SSB raises average power
  without increasing PA splatter** — the ideal outcome. (Absolute ACPR includes the OFDM
  signal's own skirts; the meaningful result is the OFF-vs-ON delta. Measurement floor
  −34 dBc.)
- OFDM-HOM on-air nuance — the dense variants `OFDM52-{8PSK,16QAM,32QAM,64QAM}` DO show
  on-air regrowth with CE-SSB ON (ACPR-lower Δ +1.2/+2.8/+4.2/+0.7 dB), but it is **PA
  compression, not the conditioner** (its digital output is clean on all HOM modes,
  ±0.7 dB). CE-SSB raises the peaky HOM signals' average power a lot (+2.4…+7 dB), so at
  *full* drive the PA overdrives. A 32QAM-ON drive sweep: ACPR −21.7 dBc @ALC 61 (full)
  → **−29.1 dBc @ALC ~31 (~35% drive)**, with output power essentially unchanged
  (PO 36→32) — i.e. the extra drive above proper level is pure splatter, no power.
  **Operator guidance: with CE-SSB on dense HOM, set audio drive for moderate ALC
  (~30–40, standard data-mode practice); don't slam the ALC.** Then CE-SSB on HOM is
  clean *and* keeps its power.

### 10.6 — Remaining follow-ons (deferred)
- Dual-station hardware validation of the OTA ladder (rpi51↔rpi52) per the runbooks.
- Streaming-`Agc` rollout to the PSK ladder with active-span gating — ✅ **Done (2026-06-28)**.
  Opt-in receiver AGC at the single `route_audio_stage(InputCapture)` seam (default off, after the
  notch), active-span gated via `Agc::lock`/`unlock` on the DCD squelch so leading silence can't
  ramp the gain. Engine API `enable_agc`/`disable_agc`/`configure_agc`/`agc_gain_db` +
  `agc_blocks_processed` tripwire; daemon `SetAgc` control + CLI `daemon set-agc`. Tests:
  `crates/openpulse-modem/tests/agc_loopback.rs` (4). Panel toggle parity ✅ **Done (2026-06-29)** —
  `apps/openpulse-panel/src/app.rs` adds an `AGC: ON/OFF` button in the controls column (mirrors the
  Notch/CE-SSB toggles, default off) that sends `ControlCommand::SetAgc`.
- (CE-SSB on-air validation is now complete — average-power gain *and* spectral mask
  both confirmed on real RF; see §10.8.)

---

## Phase 11 — Signal-chain audit hardening (Fable full-chain audit, 2026-07) ✅ Done

A five-stream model-driven audit of the whole signal chain (single-carrier PSK / multicarrier /
FEC+ladder / DSP primitives / CE-SSB + measurement), each finding **independently reproduced** before
any fix, in the repo's ablation-first, measure-noiselessly-first culture. Seven Tier-1 correctness bugs,
the measurement-layer biases that had been flattering past conclusions, and a ranked improvement backlog —
all shipped. Per-change chains are in `docs/dev/project/traceability.md`; the audit notes live in the
session memory. Ordered execution: Tier-1 bugs → OTA-ladder re-seat → measurement fidelity → trivial wins.

### 11.1 — Tier-1 correctness bugs ✅ Done
- **DFE feedback-update sign inverted** — `LmsEqualizer` was anti-adaptive; flipped the sign (PR #697).
- **HARQ soft-LLR combining wired nowhere** — combining now engages in the daemon OTA path across
  retransmissions (`decode_combined_llrs`, additive design, superset of standalone) (PR #702).
- **M2M4 SNR estimator waveform-blind, capping the ladder ~SL8** — replaced by per-plugin symbol-domain
  SNR: PSK (PR #703), then OFDM + SC-FDMA (PR #705). M2M4 saturates ~15 dB; the plugins track to the EVM
  floor, so the OTA ladder now climbs into the dense rungs (to SL17).
- **CE-SSB crushed low-entropy OFDM frames on a clean channel** — TX bit-stream whitening scrambler (PR #698).
- **AGC/DCD seam-ordering deadlock** — carrier-detect moved before the AGC so its boost can't wedge the
  squelch (PR #699).
- **No-AGC × Costas coupling** — level-normalise symbols before PSK carrier recovery (PR #700).
- **SC-FDMA delay-cliff** — the wideband rungs cliffed at a ~10-sample delay *inside* the 32-sample CP.
  Root cause was the **sync back-off** (`SYNC_EARLY_BIAS`), not the CE reach the audit had guessed;
  raising it 8→16 extends the reach to a 2 ms (CCIR-poor) spread. A CE-basis widen was tried and reverted
  (it over-fit pilot noise and broke `llr_reliability`); `deramp_timing`'s centroid re-centring makes the
  existing ±10 basis sufficient (PR #717).

### 11.2 — OTA-ladder re-seat (OFDM beats SC-FDMA on selective fading) ✅ Done
- Bake-off confirmed OFDM ≫ SC-FDMA on selective fading at matched rate/geometry (moderate_f1 @20 dB:
  0.88 vs 0.35). Re-seated the `hpx_hf` dense rungs SL11–SL19 from SC-FDMA to OFDM (PR #704), re-indexed to
  drop the P4-duplicate rungs (PR #707), and ablated the residual moderate_f1 plateau to Doppler (not
  outage or delay-cliff) so it's recorded, not mis-fixed (PR #706). `hpx_ofdm_hf` made a complete robust
  all-OFDM dispersive-HF ladder; linksim now drives the ladder from the daemon's real `rx_snr_db` (PR #708).

### 11.3 — Measurement fidelity ✅ Done
- **Watterson +3 dB hot** path power normalised to unity (PR #701).
- **Gilbert-Elliott** stepped per-sample (sub-symbol "bursts" ≈ elevated-variance AWGN) → now steps
  per-symbol, so Bad runs span whole symbols with mean 1/p_bg symbols — a valid burst channel (PR #714).
- **Watterson re-randomised the fade every `apply()`** → opt-in continuous phase-persistent fade
  (sum-of-sinusoids), default-off so existing thresholds stay bit-identical; linksim opts in (PR #716).
- **CI goodput regression gate** — real-modem `run_link` gates that catch DSP regressions the HPX
  event-replay benchmark can't see (PR #710).
- (`estimate_additive_snr_db` multi-tap was assessed **moot** — zero consumers after linksim adopted
  `rx_snr_db` in #708 — and intentionally not built.)

### 11.4 — Improvement backlog ✅ Done
- Byte interleaver on the `SoftConcatenated` wire — burst-fade tolerance, multi-block gated (PR #709).
- LDPC rate-1/2 PEG graph replacing the random xorshift `H` (PR #711).
- RRC filter span 8→12 on the dense-constellation RRC rungs (PR #712).
- Pilot-plugin soft-LLR calibration + normalised-correlation onset (PR #713).
- QPSK1000-HF-RRC forward-only LMS — a coded Watterson sweep showed the DFE *loses* to forward-only on
  fading (error propagation), confirming the #697 note (PR #715).
- (The QPSK "window-derived β" port and wiring `freq_acquire::acquire` were assessed and **skipped** —
  wrong-premise and risky-for-no-clear-benefit respectively; recorded so they aren't re-opened.)

## Phase 12 — "Loose-ends" audit fix-down (2026-07-13) ✅ Done (one item deferred by decision)

A 10-dimension model-driven "what isn't nailed down" audit (stubs & unconsumed wiring, panics in library
paths, seam gaps, test gaps, concurrency, security/safety/regulatory, correctness, docs drift), each
finding **refuted-by-default** before it reached the report: 52 raised → 47 confirmed. All **high- and
medium-severity findings were fixed and merged** (PRs #814–#832); the deferred low-severity tail was
tracked in **issue #830** and worked down to completion. Per-change chains are in
`docs/dev/project/traceability.md` (2026-07-13/14 entries); the audit method is now a reusable skill.

### 12.1 — DSP soft-LLR calibration completion ✅ Done
Every shipped plugin's soft demod now emits calibrated 1/σ² LLRs (matters for HARQ combining / iterative
equalizers; single-frame decode is scale-invariant, so no frame-gain but the reliability gates flip from
over-confident to safely under-confident). The decision-directed noise estimator saturates on dense grids
(measured 24×–1599× over-confident); replaced by measuring σ² from a known preamble/pilot residual + a
`(1+P_c)` channel/pilot-estimation-error term. 64QAM (#833), OFDM incl. the ZF double-count (#834), pilot
(#835), and the 64QAM/psk8 GPU soft path (#837) — completing the batch SC-FDMA started in #690.

### 12.2 — §97.119 regulatory hardening ✅ Done
- **MYID-before-TX across both TNCs** — the ARDOP TNC refused to key without a valid host `MYID` (host
  data → FAULT, IRS ACK suppressed, auto-ID rejects `N0CALL`, relay suppressed) (#847); the KISS TNC, which
  has no MYID, gates on the AX.25 **source** address per frame (`Ax25Addr::source_from_frame`; common
  address header, so connected-mode is unaffected) (#848). Shared `station_id::callsign_is_valid`.
- **Regulatory TX-metadata log identity** — the daemon/ARDOP/KISS/mesh binaries never called
  `set_callsign`/`set_max_power_watts`, so the §97 log stamped an empty callsign + 0 W. Wired identity +
  a new `[station] tx_power_watts` into each engine at startup (ARDOP mirrors the runtime MYID) (#849).

### 12.3 — Route-discovery originator + consumption ✅ Done
The `RouteDiscoveryRequest/Response` codecs were codec-only. Built the driver — `RouteOriginator` /
`RouteResponder` / `RouteTable`, self-authenticating Ed25519 (#840) — and wired the **responder** into the
mesh daemon so a request targeting the node (or a cached route) is answered on-air (#841). Then closed the
loop: the mesh daemon **originates** (`discover_route`), **applies** responses into the route table, and
**consumes** a route for relay send (`send_via_route` picks via `select_best_scored_route`, which calls
`score_route`) (#850). Finally added the route-**maintenance** drive so all four msg types are driven:
signed `RelayRouteUpdate` (0x07, verify + authoritative table refresh) and unsigned but on-path-authorized
`RelayRouteReject` (0x08, teardown only from a hop actually on the route), with `MeshDaemon` dispatch +
`send_route_update`/`send_route_reject` originators (#856). **Route discovery is now fully driven
(0x03–0x08).** Deferred: source-accumulated multi-hop paths need a wire-path TLV.

### 12.4 — Robustness / concurrency ✅ Done
- **ARDOP engine lock off the async executor** — CONNECT/DISCONNECT locked the engine `std::sync::Mutex`
  inline on the executor while the worker holds it across an RF burst, stalling other clients' commands
  (incl. ABORT); moved to `spawn_blocking` like the PTT handlers (#846).
- **Lossy-broadcast PTT resync** — a client that missed a `PttChanged` edge (256-slot ring) can recover
  via a new `GetPttState` query that re-broadcasts the current state (#843).
- **Filexfer per-peer quota** counted only the top level; now recurses the `.partial/` subtree (#842).
- **Watchdog fairness** — `server::run`'s single `select!` was `biased` (commands first) with the PTT
  watchdog buried in the rx arm, so a command flood starved the rx tick **and** the watchdog. Gave the
  watchdog its own 100 ms `select!` arm and dropped `biased` → fair scheduling; the transmitter's
  force-release can no longer be starved (#853).
- **In-handler blocking half — independent PTT watchdog thread ✅ Done (#863, PR #867).** A QSY scan /
  OTA send-retry holds the async command arm for tens of seconds; during that window the `select!` loop
  never re-enters, so even the #853 watchdog *arm* doesn't run. **Approach B** shipped: the PTT controller
  and its deadline now live behind one `SharedPtt(Arc<Mutex<PttInner>>)` (single source of truth), driven
  by an **independent OS-thread watchdog** (`spawn_watchdog`) that force-releases on the 180 s deadline
  every 100 ms regardless of what the async loop is doing — a plain thread (immune to runtime flavor /
  worker starvation), holding only a `Weak` so it exits when the daemon drops `runtime_state`. The mutex
  is held only for one hardware call or a deadline read/write, never across an RF burst, so the thread can
  preempt at any point. `RuntimeControlState` swapped its `ptt_asserted_at`/`ptt_max_duration` fields for
  `ptt: SharedPtt`; `server.rs` routes every key/unkey site through it (−104 lines of scattered
  bookkeeping). A Fable adversarial review added two upgrades past parity: a **stuck rig** keeps the
  watchdog armed + silent and is retried every tick (pre-#863 cleared + falsely reported release), and all
  `PttChanged` edges are emitted under the lock so a concurrent re-key can't misorder them. 8 `ptt.rs`
  unit tests incl. the blocked-loop preemption + mid-burst single-fire + stuck-rig-retry cases; can only
  be unit-tested here (no radio).

### 12.5 — Feature completions ✅ Done
- **Per-band `SetTxAttenuation`** — the control command's optional `band` was silently dropped (only the
  global engine attenuation was set). Added an engine-side per-band store + `apply_band_attenuation`
  applied on the `SetFreq` retune, mirroring the per-band DCD-squelch mechanism (#851).
- **`transmit_iq` compliance fence (audit G-2)** — the IQ path bypassed the `stage_emit_output` seam (no
  §97 log, no auto-ID arming, no attenuation). Extracted the compliance bookkeeping into a shared
  `record_tx_frame` called by both the audio seam and `transmit_iq`, which also now applies TX attenuation
  to the baseband IQ; CE-SSB / tanh peak-limit have no IQ-domain equivalent (documented) (#852).

### 12.6 — Test-coverage + docs ✅ Done
- Command-path PTT hardware-failure guard (#836); discovery DCD-busy beacon-defer (#839) + the two
  remaining `server::run` handoffs — dwell-audio tee + rendezvous-connect (#845); daemon filexfer resume →
  `FileAccept.have_bitmap` composition (#844).
- `docs/cli-guide.md` daemon/FF-15/FF-16 control CLI + the README `hpx_hf` ladder row (#838).

## Far-future items

Features deliberately deferred beyond Phase 9.  Each item requires significant design
work, hardware availability, or explicit operator configuration that is not yet in scope.

### FF-3 — Root-raised-cosine matched filtering ✅ Done (PR #158)

RRC reduces the occupied bandwidth to `(1 + α) × Rs` Hz.  At α = 0.35 this is 1350 Hz
for 1000 baud — well within 2700 Hz and comparable to VARA 500 Hz mode spectral
efficiency.

**What was delivered**:
- TX: RRC FIR TX filter (span = 8 symbols, α = 0.35) replacing cosine/Hann amplitude
  shaping for all `-RRC` mode variants.
- RX: matched RRC filter + Gardner timing error detector for adaptive symbol timing
  recovery across BPSK-RRC, QPSK-RRC, and 8PSK-RRC.  `GardnerDetector::pre_arm()`
  bridges brute-force preamble acquisition to the adaptive tracking loop.
- Costas PLL (decision-directed, psk_order=2 for QPSK, psk_order=3 for 8PSK) for
  coherent carrier recovery on QPSK-RRC and 8PSK-RRC.  BPSK keeps differential
  detection (NRZI-encoded; coherent detection would break the protocol).
- Integration tests: `rrc_channel_loopback.rs` — 5 tests covering BPSK250-RRC,
  QPSK500-RRC, and 8PSK500-RRC on clean channel and AWGN 20 dB.

**Note**: adaptive equalizer (LMS/DFE) deferred — at 1000 baud on HF the symbol period
(1 ms) is comparable to multipath delay spread, but FEC already provides adequate
protection on Good F1 channels.  Equalizer remains a future option.

---

### FF-4 — OFDM wideband HF profile ✅ Done (PR #167)

OFDM multi-carrier modes for HF use, with LS channel estimation and ZF equalization to handle
frequency-selective ionospheric fading.  Two sub-profiles are delivered:

| Mode | SCs | BW | Gross bps | Session SL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OFDM16 | 16 data + 4 pilot, SCs 38–57 | ≈ 625 Hz | ≈ 889 | SL5 |
| OFDM52 | 52 data + 13 pilot, SCs 16–80 | ≈ 2031 Hz | ≈ 2889 | SL6 |

Both modes: FFT=256, CP=32, QPSK per-subcarrier, centre 1500 Hz, iterative PAPR clipping
(target 6 dB), 2-byte LE length prefix.

**What was delivered**:
- `plugins/ofdm/` — new `ofdm-plugin` crate: `OfdmPlugin`, modulate, demodulate, params, channel equalization modules; 15 tests
- `crates/openpulse-core/src/profile.rs` — `hpx_ofdm_hf()` session profile (SL5=OFDM16, SL6=OFDM52)
- `crates/openpulse-core/tests/session_profile.rs` — 3 new profile tests
- `apps/openpulse-testbench/` — OFDM16 and OFDM52 modes wired into the testbench GUI with correct bandwidth markers and gross bps display
- `docs/dev/archive/backlog-fec-improvements.md` — FEC backlog items (BL-FEC-1 through BL-FEC-6) from RS research session

**Previous research** (PR #135, `crates/openpulse-modem/src/ofdm_sim.rs`):
The research showed PAPR reduction via iterative clipping degrades BER.  The production
plugin resolves this by adding per-subcarrier LS+ZF equalization, which compensates for
the amplitude distortion introduced by clipping.

---

### FF-5 — UHF/VHF wideband modes ✅ Done (PR #159)

On UHF (430 MHz) and VHF (144 MHz), the 2700 Hz bandwidth restriction does not apply.
FM voice allocations are typically 12.5–25 kHz wide.  FF-5 added two tiers of higher-
baud modes and two new `SessionProfile` constructors targeting PMR/LMR narrowband channels.

**What was delivered**:

Standard tier (8 kHz audio, fits within 12.5 kHz channel, ~2700 Hz occupied BW with α=0.35):

| Mode | Baud | n (sps) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| QPSK2000 | 2000 | 4 | Hann crossfade |
| QPSK2000-RRC | 2000 | 4 | RRC + Gardner + Costas |
| 8PSK2000 | 2000 | 4 | CosineOverlap + fc=2×baud required at n=4 |
| 8PSK2000-RRC | 2000 | 4 | RRC + Gardner + Costas |

HD tier (48 kHz audio required, fills 12.5 kHz channel, ~13 kHz BW):

| Mode | Baud | n (sps) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| QPSK9600 | 9600 | 5 | Hann; fc must be ≥ baud (use 12000 Hz) |
| QPSK9600-RRC | 9600 | 5 | RRC + Gardner + Costas |
| 8PSK9600 | 9600 | 5 | Hann; fc = 12000 Hz |
| 8PSK9600-RRC | 9600 | 5 | RRC + Gardner + Costas |

New session profiles:
- `hpx_narrowband()`: SL8=QPSK500, SL9=QPSK1000, SL10=QPSK2000-RRC, SL11=8PSK2000-RRC
- `hpx_narrowband_hd()`: SL8=QPSK9600-RRC, SL9=8PSK9600-RRC — **retired 2026-09-14 (#1359)**: both
  rungs need a 48 kHz audio path, and the engine builds every config at 8 kHz with `sample_rate`
  absent from the TOML schema, so the profile could never run. The waveforms keep their
  implementations and 48 kHz loopback tests; the profile and its advertisements are gone.

**Note on 8PSK2000 non-RRC**: at n=4 the Hann crossfade ISI exceeds 8PSK's 22.5°
decision margins (QPSK passes at n=4 because its margins are 45°).  The mode requires
`CosineOverlap` (sin² shaping, zeros at boundaries) and fc = integer multiple of baud
for adequate I/Q orthogonality.  The `-RRC` variant has no such constraint.

**Note on 64QAM at 3000–12500 baud**: original FF-5 scope included 64QAM; deferred
pending FF-4 OFDM research and FF-3 full-equalizer work.  SL12–SL20 SpeedLevel
extensions are not yet implemented.

---

### FF-1 — QSY frequency-agility protocol ✅ Done (PR #140 / PR #141)

Allows two stations to collaboratively move to a better channel when the current
frequency is impaired by QRM, QSB, or QRN.  The procedure is explicit and
operator-enabled; it is never triggered automatically.

**Operator prerequisites**
- QSY must be explicitly enabled per trust level in `config.toml`
  (`[qsy] allow_trustlevels = ["verified", "psk_verified", "reduced"]` — `reduced` is a trust-store
  key proven over air, which is what the #1252 signature demonstrates; untrusted is off by default
  but can be enabled; the operator takes responsibility).
- CAT control via hamlib must be configured and active (`[hamlib]` section).

**Procedure**

1. Either station may initiate.  The requesting station sends a `QSY_REQ` frame
   containing a request token and the number of candidate frequencies it will scan.
2. The requesting station uses hamlib to scan a configurable set of candidate frequencies
   (S-meter / noise-floor measurement), then returns to the current operating frequency.
3. It sends a `QSY_LIST` frame with an ordered list of candidate `(frequency_hz, snr_db)`
   tuples (best-first, as measured locally).
4. The partner station receives `QSY_LIST`, scans each candidate locally (hamlib), returns
   to the current frequency, and responds with a `QSY_VOTE` frame containing its own
   `(frequency_hz, snr_db)` assessments.
5. The requesting station picks the channel with the best combined score (sum of both
   stations' SNR readings), sends `QSY_ACK` naming the agreed frequency and a
   switchover time offset (seconds from now, default 5 s).
6. Both stations wait for the switchover time, command hamlib to QSY, and resume the
   session on the new frequency from where it was interrupted.

**Trust-level policy**
- `QSY_REQ` is accepted from any trust level that has `allow_trustlevels` covering the
  peer's current trust classification.
- A station may reject `QSY_REQ` with `QSY_REJECT` if QSY is disabled or hamlib is
  unavailable; the session continues on the original frequency.
- All QSY wire frames are signed with the station Ed25519 key and carry a freshness timestamp
  (#1252). Verified against the key the *handshake* established, pinned when the negotiation opens
  — an unsigned, forged or stale line is refused and keys nothing. This was true of the crate from
  the start and NOT of the daemon, which used the unsigned codec until #1252.

**New wire frames** (all CR-terminated, carried over the existing B2F data channel)
- `QSY_REQ <token> <n_candidates>` — initiate QSY scan
- `QSY_LIST <token> <freq1>,<snr1> [<freq2>,<snr2> …]` — candidate list from requester
- `QSY_VOTE <token> <freq1>,<snr1> [<freq2>,<snr2> …]` — partner's assessment
- `QSY_ACK <token> <agreed_freq_hz> <switchover_offset_s>` — confirmed channel + timing
- `QSY_REJECT <token> <reason>` — decline (hamlib unavailable, policy, etc.)

**Dependencies**: hamlib integration (new `openpulse-hamlib` crate wrapping `rigctld` TCP
interface), Phase 6.3 mesh layer (for relay-assisted QSY coordination).

### FF-2 — I/Q output mode for direct SDR integration ✅ Done (PR #150)

Allows OpenPulseHF to drive SDR radios (QMX, HermesLite 2, ADALM-Pluto, RTL-SDR TX,
etc.) directly with complex baseband I/Q audio, achieving single-signal generation
comparable to what the QMX does internally: zero unwanted sideband, zero residual carrier,
no reliance on the transceiver's SSB filter for image suppression.

**Motivation**: The current architecture generates a real-valued audio signal at ~1500 Hz
and feeds it to a conventional SSB transceiver.  The radio's SSB filter provides sideband
and carrier suppression, but with finite roll-off.  I/Q output bypasses this entirely:
the modem generates complex baseband (I on left channel, Q on right channel of a stereo
stream), and the SDR upconverts directly to RF with mathematically exact suppression.

**Required changes**

- `ModulationPlugin::modulate_iq()` — new optional trait method returning `(Vec<f32>,
  Vec<f32>)` I/Q baseband samples at a configurable baseband rate (default 0 Hz centre,
  i.e. DC-centred); default implementation wraps the existing real `modulate()` via
  analytic signal (Hilbert transform).
- `AudioBackend::open_iq_output()` — new optional trait method opening a stereo output
  stream where left = I, right = Q; `CpalBackend` implements this when the device
  supports stereo output; `LoopbackBackend` stores interleaved I/Q for testing.
- `ModemEngine::transmit_iq()` — dispatches via `modulate_iq()` and `open_iq_output()`;
  falls back to real `transmit()` if either is unavailable.
- `openpulse-config`: `[audio] iq_output = true` flag; `iq_device` name override.
- Native I/Q implementations in `bpsk-plugin` and `qpsk-plugin` (trivial — the
  modulators already compute I/Q internally; the real output is just `I·cos - Q·sin`).

**What this does NOT change**: the demodulator path, the wire protocol, FEC, framing,
or any higher-layer logic.  It is purely a signal-generation and audio-output concern.

**Dependencies**: Phase 6.2 (CpalBackend is already wired; stereo output needs testing
on real hardware), SDR radio with stereo line-in capability (QMX, HermesLite, etc.).

---

### FF-6 — Binary WebSocket spectrum channel ✅ Done (PR #157)

Extend the daemon control protocol (Phase 7.3) with a binary frame channel for spectrum
data, eliminating JSON serialisation overhead on high-frequency FFT updates.

**Motivation**: Mercury-Qt uses a hybrid protocol — JSON for control commands, binary
frames (magic header + float32 array) for spectrum data.  At 20 Hz waterfall updates
with 512 bins, JSON encoding wastes ~8 KB/s per client vs. ~4 KB/s for raw float32.

**Implementation**:
- Binary frame format: `[0x4F 0x50 0x53 0x50] (magic "OPSP") | fft_size: u16 LE |
  sample_rate: u32 LE | bins: [f32 LE × fft_size]`.
- Control port (Phase 7.3) gains a `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` upgrade
  path: client sends `{"cmd": "subscribe_spectrum", "fps": 20}` → server begins
  interleaving binary frames into the connection alongside NDJSON events.
- `openpulse-panel` (Phase 7.4) subscribes at startup and feeds the float32 array
  directly into its waterfall texture, bypassing JSON parse and float conversion.

**Acceptance**: panel waterfall updates at 20 fps with < 5 ms latency on loopback;
existing NDJSON event consumers are unaffected.

**Dependencies**: Phase 7.3 (control protocol), Phase 7.4 (panel consumes spectrum).

---

### FF-7 — Tanh TX limiter ✅ Done (PR #149)

Apply a soft-limiting (tanh) compressor on the modulated audio output immediately before
the audio backend, preventing ADC clipping and reducing PA non-linearity on hot signals.

**Motivation**: FreeDV applies tanh limiting for full-duplex mode, but it is useful
generally: at the top of the HPX rate ladder (8PSK1000-RRC), the RRC filter produces
occasional amplitude peaks ~3 dB above RMS.  A soft limiter with a threshold at +2 dB
above RMS absorbs these without audible distortion, reducing the PA back-off requirement.

**Implementation**:
- `pub fn tanh_limit(samples: &mut [f32], threshold: f32)` in `openpulse-audio` (or
  `openpulse-core`): apply `threshold * tanh(s / threshold)` per sample.
- `ModemEngine::transmit()` applies `tanh_limit` with a configurable threshold
  (default `1.5 × RMS`; `[audio] tx_limiter_threshold` config key; 0.0 = disabled).
- No changes to any plugin or demodulator.

**Acceptance**: peak amplitude of QPSK1000-RRC frame after limiting does not exceed
`threshold`; BER on clean loopback is unchanged.

**Dependencies**: Phase 5.6 (CpalBackend audio path), FF-3 (RRC modes benefit most).

---

### FF-8 — Per-band TX attenuation memory ✅ Done (PR #148)

Store the operator's last TX gain setting per amateur band segment and restore it
automatically when the rig tunes to that band.

**Motivation**: FreeDV stores per-band TX attenuation because operators use different
power levels on different bands (40 m full power, 30 m QRP-only, etc.).  Manual
re-adjustment on every band change is error-prone.

**Implementation**:
- `[tx_levels]` TOML section: `"40m" = -3.0`, `"30m" = -10.0`, etc.; band names follow
  IARU Region 1 edge frequencies; `"default" = 0.0` for unrecognised frequencies.
- After each `RigctldController::get_frequency()` call (Phase 7.1), map the result to
  a band segment; scale TX samples by `10^(attenuation_db / 20)`.
- `openpulse-panel` toolbar gains a `TX atten: X.X dB` slider that writes to the in-
  memory value and persists to `[tx_levels]` on change.

**Acceptance**: operator sets -6 dB on 40 m; tunes to 20 m (0 dB); tunes back to 40 m
— attenuation returns to -6 dB without operator action; persists across restart.

**Dependencies**: Phase 7.1 (RigctldController for frequency readback), Phase 7.4 (panel).

---

### FF-9 — Reactor pattern for HPX state machine ✅ Done (PR #151)

Replace the monolithic `HpxSession` state machine with an event-driven reactor pattern,
decoupling protocol events from state transitions.

**Motivation**: Mercury replaced its monolithic ARQ state machine with a modular reactor
because concurrent protocol states became unmanageable in a single match block.
OpenPulseHF's `HpxSession` is straightforward today, but as relay (Phase 6.3),
asymmetric rate adaptation (Phase 9.2), broadcast (Phase 9.5), and QSY (FF-1) are all
wired in, the number of concurrent state combinations will grow.

**What changes**:
- `HpxSession` becomes `HpxReactor` holding a `HashMap<SessionId, SessionState>` and a
  bounded event queue.
- `HpxReactor::dispatch(event: HpxEvent)` routes events to per-state handler functions;
  no direct state mutation outside handlers.
- Existing `HpxState` and `HpxEvent` enums are unchanged; HPX conformance tests serve as
  the acceptance gate.
- Wire protocol and all wire frame types are unaffected.

**Timing**: defer until at least Phase 9.5 (broadcast) is implemented; only undertake
the refactor if the state machine branch count exceeds ~50 arms.

**Acceptance**: all existing `hpx_conformance_integration` tests pass unchanged.

**Dependencies**: Phase 9.5, FF-1 — implement after at least two of these add concurrent
states to `HpxSession`.

---

### FF-10 — zstd dictionary compression ✅ Done (PR #156)

Added `CompressionAlgorithm::Zstd` backed by a pre-trained shared dictionary built from
typical HPX/Winlink message content (structured headers, callsigns, common phrases).

- `zstd` crate dependency added to `openpulse-core`; `train_from_buffer` API used by `openpulse-dict-trainer` offline tool.
- Dictionary artifact embedded at compile time; falls back to no-dictionary if absent.
- `ConReq`/`ConAck` negotiation extended: `Zstd` variant carries a 4-byte dictionary ID so both sides confirm they are using the same dictionary version before enabling it.
- `CompressionAlgorithm::Zstd` in `openpulse-core/src/compression.rs`; `compress_if_smaller` selects Zstd when it beats LZ4 and the plain payload.
- `openpulse-dict-trainer` binary collects loopback payloads as a training corpus.

**Dependencies**: Phase 2.7 (compression layer) ✅.

---

### FF-11 — Authenticated voice shim for FreeDV ✅ Done (PR #162)

FreeDV transmits codec2-compressed voice digitally, but provides no cryptographic
guarantee that a received frame was actually produced by the claimed operator.  Replay
attacks and synthetic voice injection are undetectable at the FreeDV layer.

**Implemented** in `crates/openpulse-freedv-auth`:

- **Authentication model**: station-identity signing — `{callsign, timestamp_utc,
  session_nonce, freq_hz, mode, pubkey}` as JSON, signed with Ed25519 under the
  `OPAB` signing domain. ("Canonical" here is serde **declaration order**, not key-sorting —
  the same label-not-a-property that #1147 records for the handshakes.)
  Satisfies FCC Part 97 ID without per-frame audio signing overhead.
- **Interface**: FreeDV Qt-GUI UDP data port (`127.0.0.1:10001`).  Pure-Rust, no
  C FFI, fully compatible with `--no-default-features`.
- **`AuthBeacon`**: Ed25519-signed JSON, framed as `[OPAB][version: u8][u16 BE len][JSON]`
  since #1206 — the magic and version are read from `SigningDomain::AuthBeacon`, so the
  transmitted byte and the signed byte are one value. `sign()`, `verify()`, `encode()`,
  `decode()` API. **Corrected 2026-08-27: this said "≈144 bytes", which was the research
  doc's binary-encoding *budget* (`research/freedv-auth-research.md:64`) quoted as if it
  described the shipped format.** Measured: **356 B of JSON, 363 B on the wire** — the hex
  nonce/pubkey/signature fields alone floor it near 341 B. That ~2.5× overrun is why a
  JSON→binary re-encode is likely if FF-11 is ever wired, and why the version token (which
  makes that a branch rather than a break) was worth taking in the pre-1.0 window.
- **`BeaconScheduler`**: sends a beacon immediately then every configured interval.
- **`FreeDvDataPort`**: async tokio UDP wrapper for beacon injection and receive.
- **`TrustVerdict`**: `Verified / Unverified / Invalid` with Unix-socket server for
  companion UI polling.
- `sign_bytes` / `verify_bytes` primitives exposed from `openpulse-core/src/signing.rs`.
- 13 tests (8 unit + 5 integration) all passing.

**Dependencies**: Phase 2.3 (Ed25519 signing) ✅, Phase 3.1 (optional PQ hybrid) ✅.

### FF-12 — SC-FDMA waveform ✅ Done (PR #175)

Analysis of five 5G-era multi-carrier schemes (FBMC, UFMC, GFDM, SC-FDMA, OFDMA) against HF
radio constraints was conducted 2026-05-09.  See `docs/dev/archive/backlog-waveforms.md` for the full
analysis.

**Conclusion**: SC-FDMA (DFT-spread OFDM) is the only scheme with a clear HF benefit:
3–4 dB lower PAPR than OFDM without iterative clipping, with identical one-tap ZF channel
equalization. All other schemes either add receiver complexity with no HF gain (FBMC, UFMC,
GFDM) or are inapplicable to peer-to-peer links (OFDMA).

The OOB distortion gate was removed: localized SC-FDMA (52/256 subcarriers) achieves
~8–11 dB PAPR naturally without hard clipping. The benefit over OFDM is the absence of
clipping-induced OOB spectral regrowth, not that PAPR is numerically below any fixed target.

**Delivered**: `plugins/scfdma/` — `SCFDMA16` (625 Hz BW, ~889 bps) and `SCFDMA52`
(2031 Hz BW, ~2889 bps) modes; DFT-spread TX, IDFT de-spread RX, shared LS/ZF channel
estimation with OFDM; registered in CLI and testbench.

**Acceptance criterion**: SC-FDMA52 loopback at Watterson F1 SNR=15 dB achieves equal or
better BER than OFDM52, with ≥ 3 dB lower measured PAPR.

**Dependencies**: FF-4 (OFDM plugin) ✅.

### FF-13 — Generic serial CAT for rigs not in hamlib ✅ Done (PR #173)

Current rig control is fully dependent on hamlib (`rigctld`) for frequency/mode/level
commands.  Rigs that are unsupported or only partially supported by hamlib cannot use
CAT-dependent features (QSY, per-band TX attenuation, remote rig control) and must fall
back to `SerialRtsDtrPtt` (PTT only) or `VoxPtt`.

**Goal**: add a `GenericSerialCat` backend in `crates/openpulse-radio/` that lets users
define a rig's CAT protocol via a small TOML script (command templates + response parsers),
without requiring a hamlib driver.

**Scope**:
- `crates/openpulse-radio/src/generic_cat.rs`: `GenericSerialCat` implementing `PttController`
  and a new `CatController` trait (subset: `set_frequency`, `get_frequency`, `set_mode`, PTT).
- TOML rig definition format: one file per rig model, listing baud rate, byte framing, and
  per-command byte sequences with optional regex response parser.
- `crates/openpulse-config/`: `[rig]` section gains `backend = "generic"` and `rig_file = "path/to/rig.toml"`.
- Ship at least two reference rig files: Icom CI-V (e.g. IC-7300) and Yaesu FT-8x7 binary CAT.

**Limitations accepted at this stage**: features that require real-time level polling
(S-meter-driven SNR, ALC feedback, power-out reporting) will be unavailable or return
`RadioError::Unsupported` unless the rig definition provides the relevant command.  The
QSY and per-band-attenuation features will work as long as `set_frequency` is defined.

**Acceptance criterion**: IC-7300 or FT-817 loopback test (using a mock serial port) sets
frequency, mode, and PTT via `GenericSerialCat`; `RigctldController`-dependent paths
degrade gracefully to `RadioError::Unsupported` when the rig file omits the command.

**Dependencies**: Phase 1.5 (`openpulse-radio` crate) ✅, Phase 5.3 (TOML config) ✅.

### FF-14 — SC-FDMA PAPR: non-interleaved pilot redesign *(SUPERSEDED by the OFDM HOM ladder, PR #407)*

**Dropped 2026-06-16.** The premise — that de-interleaving the pilots would recover ~6–8 dB
of PAPR and make SC-FDMA the dense-mode workhorse — did not hold. A prototype measured the
*realized* gain from contiguous pilots at only **~3.8 dB** (12.7 → ~8.9 dB): OpenPulseHF's
SC-FDMA is a **real-valued passband** signal (Hermitian symmetry, 1500 Hz centre), and the
~3 dB real-bandpass penalty floors it well above textbook complex-baseband SC-FDMA. Single-
carrier `64QAM2000-RRC` already has lower PAPR (~6.6 dB) *and* out-throughputs
`SCFDMA52-64QAM`, so SC-FDMA is **dominated** — no PAPR edge, and worse frequency-selective
fade handling (DFT-despread noise enhancement) than OFDM.

**Replacement — the OFDM higher-order ladder** (PR #407, `docs/mode-fec-ladder.md` §4/§7):
OFDM's CP + per-subcarrier equalization handle HF multipath natively (no despread penalty),
the industry choice for HF data (VARA HF, Mercury, ARDOP). Shipped: shared
`openpulse-dsp::constellation` (Gray map / hard-demap / max-log-MAP soft-LLR, QPSK..64QAM);
OFDM modes `OFDM52-{8PSK,16QAM,32QAM,64QAM}`; `hpx_ofdm_hf` extended SL5→SL10. PAPR is
managed by **TX leveling, not clipping** — clipping is QPSK-only (it shreds dense
constellations) and HOM frames are **peak-normalized to a DAC-safe 0.9**. Validated on the
rpi51↔rpi52 hardware loopback: OFDM52-16QAM (uncoded + soft FEC) and OFDM52-64QAM all decode;
OFDM52-16QAM + soft FEC decodes a Watterson Good-F1 channel through the engine.

**SC-FDMA stays as-is** — a working, hardware-validated dense-multicarrier path and the
source the OFDM HOM ladder reused for its constellation code; kept, not retired, not invested
in further.

**Other audit notes** (no action, documented for completeness): SCFDMA52-64QAM-P4 trades
throughput for dense pilots (high-Doppler use, not dominated); plain rectangular 2000-baud
single-carrier modes remain superseded by their `-RRC` variants.

### Candidate features — VarAC gap analysis *(research; not scheduled)*

Ideas OpenPulse is missing vs VarAC, ranked with fit sketches against our architecture, in
[`docs/dev/research/varac-feature-gap-analysis.md`](../research/varac-feature-gap-analysis.md).
Top gaps (all application/operator layer — the modem-layer ideas were already mined into our ACK
taxonomy/rate ladder): **direct P2P file transfer** (≈90% built on SAR + LZ4 + HPX ARQ + signed
`TransferManifest` — highest value-to-effort, standalone), **native calling-frequency CQ + slots +
monitoring** (complements FF-15's JS8 discovery), **VMail-style P2P store-and-forward** (peer-hosted
mailbox between Winlink and mesh relay), **live keyboard-to-keyboard chat** (authenticated, unlike
VarAC), and **alert tags + canned messages** (small, high daily value; turns the NDJSON control port
into an extension API). File transfer, alerts, and chat are standalone (no JS8 dependency). Not
scheduled — pending maintainer selection.

### FF-16 — Direct P2P file transfer *(Phases A–E shipped; F on-air deferred)*

**Plan approved 2026-07-10** (#730) — full design in
[`docs/dev/design/file-transfer-plan.md`](../design/file-transfer-plan.md) (decisions D1–D5 locked).
**Phases A–E shipped** (PRs #731–#743); only **Phase F (on-air validation)** remains, in the deferred
field-test batch. The top VarAC-gap item (`docs/dev/research/varac-feature-gap-analysis.md`): send a
file to a connected peer over an RF session with an offer/accept handshake, progress, size-gated
auto-accept, and **cryptographic verification VarAC lacks** (inline signed `TransferManifest` + SHA-256,
verified against the peer's CONREQ/CONACK key; verify-fail → quarantine + UNVERIFIED badge).

- A (#731) `openpulse-filexfer` crate — `OPFX` wire codec + sender/receiver state machines (no I/O).
- B (#732) blocks over SAR + multi-object framing + modem loopback (incl. >64 KB split and tamper→verify-fail).
- C-1 (#733) daemon control surface + `[file_transfer]` config; C-2a (#734) inbound `OPFX` receive-routing
  seam (handshake preserved); C-2b (#735) receive session (offer → verify → write) + commands; C-3 (#736)
  send session (`SendFile` → offer → blocks → `FileSent`); **C acceptance (#737) — a file crosses two real
  daemons** (twin round-trip = MVP ship line).
- D (#738) panel `Tab::Files` — send, offer prompt, progress, verify badge.
- E (#739) real-radio PTT burst sequencing (queue + drain); E-1 (#740) block-level resume state mechanic;
  E-2 (#741) daemon partial-block persistence + resume; airtime-bounded TX burst splitting (#743).
- Follow-ups: `ListFiles` + file-transfer CLI surface (#787).

Architecture: new pure **`crates/openpulse-filexfer`** (no-I/O wire codecs + sender/receiver state
machines, the `openpulse-b2f`/`QsySession` pattern) + a daemon `filexfer.rs` glue module (file I/O,
policy, quota). New **`OPFX`** wire magic (collision-checked; `compression::unpack` passes it through);
seven frames (FileOffer/Accept/Reject/Data/BlockAck/Complete/Cancel), each SAR-encoded through the shared
handshake receive seam. Files split into ≤48 KiB **blocks** (default 16 KiB), each `pack()`ed and carried
as one SAR segment (`segment_id = block_index + 1`; id 0 reserved for handshake) — clears the 64 005 B SAR
object cap; `block_count: u16` ⇒ ~3 GiB ceiling, config-capped at 1 MiB. Reliable delivery = **hybrid**
(OTA FSK4 per-burst rate feedback + OPFX `BlockAck` bitmap for selective retransmit); MVP stop-and-wait,
HARQ soft-combining free. Decisions: hybrid delivery; 1 MiB cap / 16 KiB blocks / auto-accept off;
daemon-host path for MVP; block-level resume in Phase E; `require_verified_peer = true` + prompt-always.

Phasing A (filexfer crate + offer/accept state machines + manifest wiring) ✅ → B (blocks/SAR + loopback
round-trip incl. >64 KB and tamper tests) ✅ → **C daemon SendFile wiring = MVP ship line** (small files,
stop-and-wait, auto-accept off) ✅ → D panel `Tab::Files` ✅ → E resume (state mechanic + daemon partial
persistence) ✅ → **F on-air validation** (deferred field-test batch). Standalone — no JS8 dependency.
Highest risk was Phase C half-duplex ACK/PTT timing — de-risked by the twin-daemon round-trip test, which now
also exercises the real PTT-keyed burst-drain path.

### FF-15 — JS8-based station discovery and rendezvous *(A–G shipped: full RX + beacon TX + rendezvous → HPX handoff; only H on-air remains)*

**Plan approved 2026-07-10** — full design in
[`docs/dev/design/js8-discovery-rendezvous-plan.md`](../design/js8-discovery-rendezvous-plan.md)
(decisions D1–D7 locked; Phases A–G implemented, only H on-air remains). When idle, an OpenPulse station QSYs to the
band's JS8 calling frequency, participates as a real, well-behaved JS8 station (heartbeats,
directed queries, station info), marks itself with an in-band `@OPULSE` capability hint, caches
other OpenPulse-marked stations in the existing `PeerCache`, and — on user request — negotiates
a working frequency over JS8, QSYs there, and hands off to a native OpenPulse HPX session
(authenticated by the post-QSY signed CONREQ/CONACK).

Architecture: **`plugins/js8`** (a genuine `ModulationPlugin` for the JS8 waveform — NORMAL
submode first: 8-GFSK, 79 symbols, Costas 3×7 sync, LDPC(174,87), tables ported from
GPL-compatible JS8Call-improved), **`crates/openpulse-discovery`** (pure no-I/O state machines:
hint codec, station table, wall-clock T/R scheduler, discovery + rendezvous SMs), and a thin
daemon glue module in `server::run`. Decisions: **native** Rust modem (Phase-B go/no-go fallback
to an external JS8Call for RX only); `@OPULSE` group beacon + INFO token; unauthenticated
2-message rendezvous; **off by default, `rx_only` when enabled**; NTP-required with hard TX
refusal beyond ±2 s skew. Phasing A (JS8 TX core) → B (RX decoder, highest risk, −18 dB gate,
go/no-go) → C (varicode + hint) → **D (RX-only discovery MVP = ship line, zero TX)** → E
(beacon/query TX — **gated on the §97.221 automatic-control regulatory doc landing first**) → F
(rendezvous + HPX handoff) → G (panel `Tab::Discovery`) → H (on-air validation vs stock JS8Call).

**Phase A TX core complete** — 8 units, PRs #744–#751, every table/algorithm **anchored to real upstream**
(the dev host has g++/Boost/Qt5+Qt6, so the actual `boost::augmented_crc` and Qt `Varicode` packers were
compiled to emit ground-truth vectors; LDPC is gated by `H·encode(m)=0`):
- A-1 (#744) `submode.rs` + `costas.rs` — submode table + Costas sync arrays (protocol foundation).
- A-2 (#745) `modulate.rs` — GFSK tone synthesis (`gen_ft8wave`+`gfsk_pulse`, BT=2.0); constant-tone Goertzel,
  partition-of-unity, phase-continuity gates.
- A-3 (#746) `ldpc174.rs` — LDPC(174,87) encode; tables ported from GPL-3.0 JS8Call, `H·c=0` over 500 msgs.
- A-4 (#747) `crc.rs` — CRC-12; bit-exact vs the real compiled `boost::augmented_crc<12,0xc06>` (20 vectors).
- A-5 (#748) `frame.rs` — `pack_callsign`/`pack_grid`; bit-exact vs verbatim upstream on real Qt (11+8 vectors).
- A-6 (#749) `tones.rs` — codeword→79 tones. **Finding: JS8 is NOT Gray-coded** (source is direct binary;
  `grep -ri gray lib/` empty) — verified against source, not the plan.
- A-7 (#750) `message.rs` — payload+flags+CRC → 87 info bits; CRC gated vs a boost-anchored `genjs8`-layout harness.
- A-8 (#751) `plugin.rs` — `Js8Plugin` `ModulationPlugin`; full TX chain, modulated audio Goertzel-decodes back
  to the exact 79 tones. `demodulate` errors (Phase B); **not yet daemon-registered** (until the decoder lands).

**Phase B complete — native RX works and PASSED the go/no-go** (PRs #753–#758). The highest-risk, FT8-class
track:
- B-1 (#753) `ldpc174.rs::bp_decode` — sum-product LDPC(174,87) BP decoder (ported `Mn`; corrects flipped/
  noisy LLRs).
- B-2 (#754) `demodulate.rs` — non-coherent 8-FSK max-log soft demod; **first RX round-trip** (message→GFSK→
  demod→decode).
- B-3 (#755) `sync.rs` — Costas 2-D (time×freq) acquisition on the **normalized** correlation.
- B-4 (#756) `decoder.rs::decode_window` — multi-decode per slot, **CRC-12 filter**, content dedup (two
  overlapping stations decode; pure noise → nothing).
- B-5 (#757) `Js8Plugin::demodulate` wired (trait round-trips); plugin stays discovery-service-owned (Phase D).
- B-6 (#758) **−18 dB go/no-go PASS** — calibrated-AWGN sweep: 12/12 to −15 dB, **11/12 at −18 dB**, floor −21 dB.
  Native decode is viable; the D1 external-JS8Call fallback is **not** needed. Acceptance gate: `snr_sweep`.

**Phase C RX grammar complete** (PRs #760–#762) — the receive path a discovery station needs:
- C-1 (#760) `frame::unpack_callsign`/`unpack_grid` — inverse field codecs, Qt-exact + round-trip.
- C-2 (#761) `grammar.rs` — `unpackCompoundFrame`/`unpackAlphaNumeric50` → `FrameType`/`CompoundFrame`/
  `Heartbeat`; **the full RX pipeline decodes a heartbeat's callsign + grid off the air** (`KN4CRD`/`EM73`).
  Finding: the 72-bit payload is `value64 ‖ rem8`, so fields read straight off the decoder's bytes.
- C-3 (#762) new **`crates/openpulse-discovery`** + `hint.rs` — the `@OPULSE` `OPHF` capability hint (base-36,
  callsign-salted CRC-8; three-way detection so organic JS8 text can't false-positive).

(TX-side packing — `packCompoundFrame`/`packAlphaNumeric50` + Huffman free text — and JSC free-text decode
were subsequently completed in the RX refinements and Phase E beacon TX below.)

**Phase D — RX-only discovery MVP logic complete** (PRs #764–#769, new `crates/openpulse-discovery`), all
pure/async-free:
- D-1 (#764) `scheduler.rs` `Js8Clock` — UTC-slot mapping, drift bias, ±2 s TX gate; `SlotTracker`.
- D-2 (#765) `station.rs` `StationTable`/`Js8Station`/`OphfHint` — upsert (SNR EWMA, sticky grid/hint) + TTL sweep.
- D-3 (#766) `peer_map.rs` — `station_to_peer_record` (key-less `Unknown`-trust) + the capability-bit registry.
- D-4 (#767) `discovery_sm.rs` `DiscoverySm` — `INACTIVE→ACTIVATING→DWELLING`, idle-predicate + preempt driven.
- D-5a (#768) `[discovery]` config section.
- D-5b (#769) `runtime.rs` `DiscoveryRuntime` — ties it together; **the full MVP flow works: idle → retune →
  dwell → decode a slot → cache `KN4CRD`/`EM73` + emit `StationHeard`** (tested on synthesized audio).

- D-5c(i) (#771) daemon **control surface**: `EnableDiscovery`/`DisableDiscovery`/`ListStations` commands +
  `DiscoveryStatus`/`StationHeard`/`StationList` events; `RuntimeControlState.discovery`; command handling.
- D-5c(ii) (#773) **live rx-tick wiring — RX-only MVP shipped**: `server::run` builds the runtime from config,
  tees dwell audio, runs `discovery_tick` (idle predicate + slot decode via `block_in_place`), executes
  retune/home-restore via CAT, forwards events. **Acceptance test:** the daemon rx-tick activates → saves home →
  tunes to JS8 → dwells → decodes an injected heartbeat → caches `KN4CRD`/`EM73` + emits `StationHeard`.

**RX-only discovery MVP SHIPPED.** An idle daemon with `[discovery] enabled` QSYs to JS8, hears + caches
stations, surfaces them via events/`ListStations` — zero TX, zero regulatory exposure.

**RX refinements** (PRs #776–#783) closed the D-phase follow-ups: per-home-band calling frequency (#776),
a true matched-filter SNR estimate calibrated vs the B-6 gate (#777), the JS8 free-text (Huffman) + directed
unpacker (#778), `@OPULSE` peer recognition via the cross-slot `HintAssembler` (#779), the shared `PeerCache`
+ `ListPeers` surface bringing `peer_map.rs` live (#780), and the full 262 144-entry JSC free-text codebook
(#783). `spawn_blocking` was already satisfied by `block_in_place`.

**Phase G — operator surface complete** (PRs #781–#782): CLI `openpulse daemon {enable-discovery,
disable-discovery, stations, peers}` (#781) and the panel `Tab::Discovery` — station table (◆OPULSE-marked)
+ peer table + Enable/Disable/Refresh + status (#782).

**Phase E — beacon TX complete** (PRs #784–#797). Off by default behind `[discovery] mode = "beacon"`/`"full"`
+ a configured callsign, gated on the §97.221 automatic-control compliance doc (`docs/regulatory.md`) plus
±2 s clock-skew, DCD, and self-ID gates. TX packers (`pack_compound_frame`/`pack_alphanumeric50`/
`pack_heartbeat_frame`/`pack_huff_frame`, Qt5-validated), `beacon.rs` (heartbeat + `@OPULSE` hint assembly),
the `ModemEngine::transmit_raw_audio` seam (no HPX `Frame` envelope) with a `raw_audio_frames_transmitted`
tripwire, the runtime slot scheduler (`maybe_transmit`), and daemon wiring (`transmit_beacon_with_ptt`, DCD
defer). OpenPulse-to-OpenPulse validated end-to-end: a beacon builds → transmits → decodes off-air → is
recognized as a peer.

**Phase F — rendezvous → HPX handoff complete** (PRs #798–#805). Decision D3's 2-message unauthenticated
exchange over JS8 directed free text, handing off to the existing signed HPX CONREQ/CONACK after QSY:
- F-1 (#798) `rendezvous.rs` — pure `RendezvousMsg` codec (`Propose`/`Accept`/`Reject` as `OPHF1 QSY?/QSY/NO`)
  + `RendezvousInitiator` + `respond()`; channels are **indices** into a per-band table, not Hz; no signature
  (the post-QSY signed CONREQ is the auth).
- F-2 (#799) config `rendezvous_channels_hz` per-band working-channel table + resolver.
- F-3a (#800) `beacon::directed` — directed free-text over targeting a callsign (generalizes `opulse_hint`).
- F-3b (#801) `rendezvous_assembler.rs` — reassembles overs directed at us into a `RendezvousMsg`.
- F-3c-i (#802) runtime orchestration — both roles, priority TX queue, `Full`-gated responder, per-slot timeout.
- F-3c-ii (#803) daemon `RendezvousWith` command + `RendezvousAgreed`/`RendezvousFailed` events + per-band
  channel wiring + startup bandplan warning gate.
- F-3c-iii (#804) QSY + CONREQ handoff — schedules the QSY after the `switch_in_slots` delay (so the Accept is
  heard), retunes, then reuses the operator `ConnectPeer` `begin_secure_session` + CONREQ path.
- F-3c-iv (#805) two-runtime end-to-end test — real GFSK audio shuttled between two `DiscoveryRuntime`s to a
  rendezvous under a manual clock (a real-time twin would take minutes per JS8's 15 s slots).

**Only Phase H (on-air validation vs stock JS8Call) remains** — in the deferred field-test batch. Later
hardening: a Pi-class CPU-budget check (`cross`) and the bit-exact `reference_vectors` (needs gfortran, the
one absent upstream tool).

profiles across low and high Doppler Watterson settings and gates that dense-pilot
absolute bit agreement is not worse than sparse-pilot at either Doppler point.

### RF-7 — the receive-bandwidth arc (#1060), 2026-08-17

The #1049 correlation veto shipped with a per-mode ρ threshold (BPSK250: 0.40) derived from that
mode's decode cliff and validated against two SSB-bandwidth, **3-second** idle captures. #1060 asked
what a *narrow* receive filter does to it. Measured on a real IC-9700 rather than modelled, the answer
is a defect: idle ρ tracks receive bandwidth, so the threshold was calibrated for one regime and blind
outside it.

| receive filter (measured −20 dB band) | per-window p50 | p99 | windows ≥ 0.40 |
|---|---|---|---|
| wide (2470 Hz) | 0.131 | 0.197 | 0.00 % |
| 500 Hz (554 Hz) | 0.236 | 0.334 | 0.07 % |
| 250 Hz (309 Hz) | 0.351 | 0.492 | **18.8 %** |

**The fix is CFAR, not a bandwidth estimator** (#1157). There is no honest signal-free sample source —
in the hot-floor regime the energy gate fires continuously, which is exactly when calibration is
needed — so the receiver estimates a robust *location* of the statistic the veto already computes and
reaches the decision level through a measured shape factor (p99/p50 = 1.29–1.50 across a 4.3× move in
p50). It can only ever **raise** the threshold, and where no threshold separates noise from a
deliverable frame it **stands down** to energy-only detection rather than vetoing everything.
Measured through the production receive path: 2470 Hz holds 0.400, 554 Hz derives 0.449, 309 Hz
derives 0.618 and stands down.

Four things this arc is worth remembering for:

1. **Peak ρ is an extreme-value statistic.** The same 500 Hz capture reads 0.319 over 3 s and 0.413
   over 45 s — and the shipped constant was validated against 3-second captures, which understate the
   ceiling of their own audio by 0.05–0.07 ρ.
2. **Ablate the confound.** The rig's USB audio carries a ~1651 Hz birdie, and a tone in the passband
   is exactly what scores high ρ. Notching it *raised* ρ, which is what established the filter as the
   mechanism rather than the interference.
3. **A decoded-only column is a tautology while the veto runs inside the decode.** #1088 recorded that
   and named the fix; #1157 built it (a plugin wrapper returning `None` from `preamble_template`,
   receiver-side only). Tripwire: 0 settle rejections, against 1010–1696 per 30 seeds in the shipped
   arm.
4. **A retraction.** "BPSK250 cannot work through a 200 Hz filter at all" was drawn from 0/180 fading
   trials and is false — it decodes cleanly noiseless (`narrow_mask_decode_check`). The 0/180 measured
   margin erosion, and the retraction is what makes the stand-down state load-bearing rather than
   vestigial: a 250 Hz-class station on a calm channel is a live configuration.

Scope, stated because it is easy to over-book: this runs on the **engine-receive surface only** — the
CLI `receive` path and the on-air tooling. The daemon never executes the veto (#1118).

### RF-6 — the HF-fade arc (v0.13.0 → v0.14.1), 2026-07-17

Three releases that started from "one dead ladder rung" and ended at "the adaptive HF link delivers on
a routine fade for the first time." Each release fixed a real bug and uncovered the next one beneath
it, because **every layer passed its own tests in isolation while the composed system delivered ~5 bps
on a `moderate_f1` fade** — the defect lived in the seams between green tests, which is the arc's
lesson. Full detail in `docs/dev/project/traceability.md` (newest-first); the authoritative `hpx_hf`
rung map is `SessionProfile::hpx_hf`, gated by `tests/ladder_doc_matches_profile.rs`.

- **v0.13.0 — one dead rung (#923, #928).** `hpx_hf` SL6 (`QPSK250+Rs`) decoded 0% on `moderate_f1` at
  *every* SNR: a coherent, absolutely phase-encoded waveform cannot hold a carrier reference through a
  1 Hz Doppler fade. Fixed with differential QPSK (`QPSK250-D`) — the fade rotation cancels
  symbol-to-symbol, the immunity BPSK already had. The two obvious alternatives (2-pass carrier
  tracker, pilot waveform) were **measured to 0%** first and rejected. Differential does **not** scale
  to 8PSK (built, measured, rejected — ±22.5° cannot absorb the noise doubling).
- **v0.14.0 — the whole ladder was calibrated for AWGN (#930–#933).** The rungs' SNR floors came from
  AWGN sweeps and most of the ladder did not work at the floors it advertised: uncoded BPSK31 — the
  `initial_level` — decoded 0% at 3/6/9 dB, and the coherent single-carrier mid rungs decoded ~0% at
  any SNR. Re-seat: **every rung coded** (differential needs FEC, and BPSK is differential too — a
  ladder-wide law, not a QPSK quirk); **OFDM above SL6** (its CP rides the delay, per-SC pilots track
  the fade); 17→14 rungs. Two measured traps recorded: "`RsStrong` is free" only ≤191 B (a second RS
  block at 192–223 B doubled airtime through the goodput floor), and the OFDM floors read in
  plugin-symbol-domain SNR that saturates ~17 dB. Reconciled + **gated** the `mode-fec-ladder.md` doc
  table (#930) after finding it had drifted across releases.
- **v0.14.1 — the rungs decoded but the controller wouldn't drive them (#934–#937).** With the rungs
  fixed, `hpx_hf` on `moderate_f1` still sat pinned on its entry rung at ~5 bps **while delivering
  20/20 frames**. Two causes, both in the rate controller's *decode* path: its only climb was
  `snr >= ceiling`, and a decoded frame with a low SNR reading demoted *below* the rung that just
  decoded. On a fade the SNR estimate is uninformative *in principle* (at 31 baud a 1 Hz fade is
  faster than any usable averaging window). Fix — **a decode is evidence, an SNR estimate is a guess,
  the evidence wins**: climb after 3 clean decodes regardless of SNR; never demote on a decode
  (demotion moved to the failure path). Prerequisite (#935): BPSK had **no** SNR estimator and fell
  back to a constant-modulus one that read a flat ≈ −4 dB from 15→35 dB; the new one removes the fade's
  multiplicative gain first. Effect: `moderate_f1` @20 dB avg level 1.5 → 4.9, final SL1 → SL11.
- **The gate that closes the arc: `psk_ladder_climbs_off_the_entry_rung_on_a_fade`** drives the *real
  rate controller* on a fading channel. Every earlier fade gate called the demodulator directly, so it
  could prove the rungs decode but never that the controller drives them — the exact blind spot that
  let #934 ship in two releases. Same "test the production path, not the convenience seam" lesson the
  codebase keeps relearning, now enforced.
- **Both former "still open" items are now closed.** The SC-vs-OFDM SNR-scale split was investigated
  and found to be **per-waveform-family by physical necessity, not a wart**: OFDM's ZF equaliser
  enhances noise on faded subcarriers, so its estimate saturates near ~16 dB and cannot report the
  20–30 dB the top rungs run at. Unifying it would put those floors out of reach — the v0.14.0 stall.
  Documented and pinned by `snr_scale_boundary` (PR #944). `RsStrong` on small frames shipped in
  PR #941: the sender upgrades per frame only where it costs no extra RS block, so airtime cannot
  regress, and the receiver dual-decodes (`free_rs_strengthening_ota`).
  **Not yet validated on air** — three releases of fade behaviour are Watterson-simulator-only, and the
  linksim harness gap found in v0.14.1 (it could not transmit the sub-floor rung) is a reminder that
  simulator-green is not hardware-green.

### RF-1 confirmed root cause (PR #212)

Two bugs in the Watterson model caused the 0/20 failure — not a demodulator or timing issue:

**Bug 1 — Independent fading per 1024-sample block.** The model regenerated completely new random envelopes every 1024 samples, creating 65 discontinuous channel jumps within a single RS-encoded frame (~66 k samples). Fix: generate one FFT-shaped envelope per `apply()` call, sized to `next_power_of_two(signal_len)`.

**Bug 2 — Magnitude-only fading creates a static frequency-domain null.** Using `h.norm()` discards the random ionospheric phase, leaving the combining sign set purely by geometry:
- Good F2 (delay 1.0 ms) at fc=1500 Hz: `cos(2π·1500·0.001) = cos(3π) = −1` → permanent destructive null → 0/20
- Good F1 (delay 0.5 ms) at fc=1500 Hz: `cos(3π/2) = 0` → delayed ray orthogonal to I channel → harmless

Fix: use `h.re × √2` so the complex Gaussian's random phase randomises the combining sign per frame, breaking static nulls while preserving unit mean-square amplitude.

After the fix, BPSK250 + RS FEC + block interleaver correctly decodes through Good F2 (seed 5). Differential detection handles frames where the fading sign is consistent throughout; FEC+interleaver corrects the burst errors at sign-transition boundaries.

## Profile scope decisions — active vs deferred modes (updated 2026-05-19)

### SessionProfile table

Every profile in `SessionProfile::PROFILE_NAMES`, in registry order. `profile.rs` is the source of
truth and this table is **gated against it** by `tests/roadmap_profile_table.rs` — it cannot drift.
Decision 18 (2026-10-01) reduced the registry to two profiles on the one `hpx_hf` ladder: `fast` and
`robust` (capped at SL6); the other ten were deleted. "SL range" is what the profile can reach. "Top mode" is the mode at the highest reachable level (its FEC and the full rung map live in
`profile.rs`; the `hpx_hf` rung map is additionally gated against `docs/mode-fec-ladder.md`). To
regenerate after a profile change, run the printer named in that test.

| Profile | SL range | Initial | Top mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fast` | SL1–SL14 | SL2 | OFDM52-64QAM |
| `robust` | SL1–SL6 | SL2 | QPSK250-D |

### Mode-to-plugin mapping

Which plugin owns each profile-reachable mode. The "profile slot" column is an **informational
snapshot, not gated** — the authoritative per-level mapping is the (gated) SessionProfile table above
plus `profile.rs`; this column just says roughly where each mode is used. The mode → plugin half is
stable (a mode's owning plugin does not change).

| Mode | Plugin | Profile slot (informational) |
|---|---|---|
| MFSK16 | mfsk16-plugin | hpx_hf SL1 (non-coherent sub-floor) |
| BPSK31/63/100/250 | bpsk-plugin | hpx_hf SL2–SL5 (all RS-coded — RF-6); BPSK250/QPSK250 also `hpx_modcod` SL2–SL5 |
| QPSK250 | qpsk-plugin | hpx500 SL5, hpx_modcod SL4–SL5 |
| QPSK250-D | qpsk-plugin | hpx_hf SL6 (differential — RF-6) |
| QPSK500/1000 | qpsk-plugin | hpx500 SL6; hpx_modcod SL6–SL7; hpx_narrowband/hpx_wideband SL8–SL9 |
| QPSK2000-RRC | qpsk-plugin | hpx_narrowband SL10 |
| 8PSK1000 | psk8-plugin | hpx_wideband SL11 |
| 8PSK2000-RRC | psk8-plugin | hpx_narrowband SL11 |
| OFDM52/OFDM52-{8PSK,16QAM,32QAM,64QAM} | ofdm-plugin | hpx_hf SL7–SL14 (SC then high-rate LDPC — RF-6) |
| OFDM16/OFDM52/OFDM52-{8PSK,16QAM,32QAM,64QAM} | ofdm-plugin | hpx_ofdm_hf SL5–SL10 |
| PILOT-QPSK/8PSK/16QAM/32APSK500(/1000)(-RRC) | pilot-plugin | hpx_pilot / _rrc / _fast / _fast_rrc SL2–SL5 |
| SCFDMA26-{8PSK,16QAM,32QAM} | scfdma-plugin | hpx_wideband_hd SL9–SL11 (narrowband fallback) |
| SCFDMA52-{16QAM,32QAM,64QAM} | scfdma-plugin | hpx_wideband_hd SL12–SL14 |
| 64QAM2000-RRC | 64qam-plugin | hpx_wideband_hd SL15 |

### Modes in plugins but not in any profile (manual-select only — intentional)

These modes are registered and usable via explicit mode selection (CLI `--mode`, daemon `SetMode`,
linksim/testbench) but are **deliberately not** in any adaptive `SessionProfile` ladder — not an
oversight. The 64QAM/dense-pilot variants are aggressive VHF/UHF or research waveforms without a rung
in the HF ladders. Adding any to a profile is a mode-scope decision (measure it against the
neighbouring rung first — see the "code rate is the last lever" note), not a gap to close. The claim
"in no profile" is **gated** by `tests/roadmap_profile_table.rs` — a mode listed here that later joins
a ladder (as BPSK100 did in the RF-6 re-seat, moving it out of this list) fails the build.

| Mode | Plugin | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SCFDMA52-64QAM-P4 | scfdma-plugin | Dense-pilot research variant; no profile slot |
| 64QAM500 / 64QAM1000 | 64qam-plugin | Aggressive VHF/UHF; manual-select only |

### Daemon-level implementation gaps (2026-05-19 — both resolved 2026, PR #321)

Found during implementation audit; both have since been wired.

| Gap | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `accept_qsy` records decision but does not invoke `QsySession` or transmit RF QSY frames | `crates/openpulse-daemon/src/lib.rs` | ✅ Done (PR #321) — `QsySession` wired into `AcceptQsy`; QSY_REQ/QSY_LIST transmitted via the modem engine |
| `enable_repeater` sets flag and emits event but does not spawn CrossBandRepeater audio routing thread | `crates/openpulse-daemon/src/lib.rs` | ✅ Done (PR #321) — `EnableRepeater` spawns the repeater thread via `run_full_duplex`; `DisableRepeater` stops and joins it |

### Control-surface parity gaps (audit 2026-06-27)

Audited every `ControlCommand` variant for reachability across the three surfaces (daemon
handler / CLI `daemon` subcommand / panel GUI button) — the "wired at one seam, not all" lens
applied to the control surface. All 28 variants are handled by the daemon (no dead commands).
The reachability gaps:

Original audit (2026-06-27) gap rows, all since **closed** (status as of 2026-06-29):

| Command | Daemon | CLI | Panel | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SendMessage` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — `daemon send-message` (`cli.rs`) |
| `SetMode` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — `daemon set-mode` |
| `PttAssert` / `PttRelease` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — `daemon ptt-assert` / `ptt-release` |
| `AcceptQsy` / `RejectQsy` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — `daemon accept-qsy` / `reject-qsy` |
| `SetFreq` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✅ CLI-reachable — `daemon set-freq` (panel via config) |
| `SetDcdSquelch` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — panel Squelch slider |
| `SetAgc` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — panel `AGC: ON/OFF` toggle (2026-06-29) |
| `SetTxAttenuation` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ closed — CLI `daemon set-tx-attenuation` (2026-06-29; a wiring-gap audit found it panel-only) |
| `StartOtaSession` / `StopOtaSession` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | panel only locks/unlocks an active session |
| `OtaSetLevelBounds` / `OtaSetHysteresis` / `OtaSetAggressiveness` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | expert OTA tuning, CLI-only by design |

All the reachability gaps the audit flagged are now closed: the CLI gained `send-message`,
`set-mode`, `ptt-assert`/`ptt-release`, `accept-qsy`/`reject-qsy`; the panel gained the live Squelch
slider and (2026-06-29) the `AGC: ON/OFF` toggle. The OTA hysteresis/aggressiveness/bounds CLI-only
split is intentional (the panel offers the simplified lock/unlock instead). No control-surface
parity gaps remain.

### TNC command-surface audit (2026-06-27)

Audited the ARDOP + KISS TNCs for the "accepted/advertised but not applied" gap class.

**ARDOP** (`crates/openpulse-ardop/src/command.rs`): 15 commands are fully implemented; 3 are
accepted + validated + echoed but **not applied** to the modem — `GRIDSQUARE` (informational),
`ARQBW` and `ARQTIMEOUT` (stored, never read by the engine: OpenPulseHF self-manages bandwidth and
session timeout via its adaptive rate ladder, not a host hint). `CWID` / `SENDID` are honest stubs
(warn-logged). Now documented as such (code comment + `docs/non-gpl-interfacing.md`). Real fix, if
host-driven ARQ control is ever wanted: wire `ARQBW`/`ARQTIMEOUT` into `transmit_arq`.

**KISS** (`crates/openpulse-kiss/src/server.rs`): only `KISS_DATA` (0x00) is applied; the control
frames (TXDELAY 0x01, P 0x02, SlotTime 0x03, TXtail 0x04, FullDuplex 0x05, SetHardware 0x06) were
**silently** dropped. They're advisory PTT/CSMA-timing hints and this TNC manages PTT/channel access
itself, so dropping is acceptable per the KISS spec — now logged (`debug!`) instead of silent. Real
fix, if host TX-timing control is wanted: honor TXDELAY/TXtail/P/SlotTime.

#### ARQBW/ARQTIMEOUT now real ✅ Done (2026-06-29)

**Resolved** by building the feature the blocked-finding below called for:
1. **Opt-in adaptive ARQ session** — `[ardop] enable_adaptive_arq` (+ `adaptive_profile`); `main.rs`
   calls `start_adaptive_session`, so `current_tx_level()` is `Some` and the worker takes the
   adaptive `transmit_arq` / `receive_with_ack_hint` branch instead of fixed-mode.
2. **rate_policy bandwidth cap** — `RateAdapter::clamp_to` / `BiDirRateAdapter::clamp_to`;
   `RateAdaptationPolicy::set_max_tx_level` (clamps now + enforces on AckUp);
   `ModemEngine::set_arq_max_tx_level` + `adaptive_profile_modes`;
   `openpulse_qsy::bandplan::max_speed_level_for_bandwidth` maps a Hz cap to a max level.
3. **ARQBW → cap, ARQTIMEOUT → disconnect** — the `bridge.rs` worker applies the ARQBW cap when it
   changes and drops an idle connection after ARQTIMEOUT seconds of no successful exchange.

With adaptive ARQ **off** (the default), there is no ladder/connection to bound, so the host hints
stay accepted-and-echoed no-ops (not a "defined-but-not-consumed" gap — they act the moment a
session is enabled). Tests: `arq_max_tx_level_caps_the_adaptive_ladder` +
`arq_max_tx_level_clamps_an_already_high_session` (modem), `max_speed_level_for_bandwidth_maps_hz_cap_to_a_level`
(qsy). Original blocked-finding (2026-06-28) kept below for history.

#### Why "wire ARQBW/ARQTIMEOUT for real" was blocked (deeper investigation 2026-06-28)

Attempting the real wiring surfaced that it's the same class of gap as the signed-handshake one: the
**ARDOP TNC never drives the adaptive session the host hints would bound.**
- `crates/openpulse-ardop/src/main.rs` builds a `ModemEngine` and registers plugins but never calls
  `start_adaptive_session` / `start_ota_session`. So `current_tx_level()` is always `None` and
  `worker_loop` (`bridge.rs`) always takes the **fixed-`mode` path** (`transmit`/`receive`), never
  the adaptive `transmit_arq` / `receive_with_ack_hint` branch. The rate ladder is dormant.
- So `ARQBW` (a Hz cap on the ladder) has no ladder to cap, and `ARQTIMEOUT` (an ARQ connection
  timeout) has no ARQ session/connection to time out — the worker does single-shot per-frame
  `receive(mode, None)`.
- Worse, the only existing bandwidth-cap lever, `ModemEngine::ota_set_level_bounds`, targets the
  **OTA** controller (`self.ota`), whereas the worker's `current_tx_level()` reads the **rate_policy**
  controller (`start_adaptive_session`) — different mechanisms. There is no rate_policy bandwidth cap
  to wire `ARQBW` to today.

Wiring a no-op into these dead fields would just re-create the "defined-but-not-consumed" gap the
2026-06-27 audit removed, so it was deliberately NOT done. **Real fix (a feature, not a wire):**
(1) make the ARDOP TNC optionally run an adaptive ARQ session (opt-in config → `start_adaptive_session`,
activating the worker's existing adaptive branch); (2) add a rate_policy bandwidth cap
(`SessionProfile` mode→occupied-bandwidth via `openpulse-qsy::bandplan::occupied_bandwidth_hz`) and a
connection-timeout loop; (3) then `ARQBW`→cap and `ARQTIMEOUT`→timeout become real. Tracked here; not
scheduled.

### Config/feature gaps — defined but not consumed (audit 2026-06-27)

Audited every `OpenpulseConfig` field for a reader (the "defined but not consumed" gap). 72 of 79
fields are consumed; the recently-added notch/QSY/logbook fields are all wired. The dead ones —
config you can set that does nothing — all sit in `[radio]`:

| Field(s) | Why dead | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `[radio.rig_a]` (whole `RigConfig`) | The daemon configures the primary rig via the **top-level** `[radio]`; `cfg.radio.rig_a` is never read. | Still reserved for the planned multi-rig refactor; docs/template mark it accurately. |
| `RigConfig.backend` / `serial_port` / `rig_file` (the `rig_a` copies) | Per-rig copies, unread; the daemon reads the top-level `[radio]` equivalents. | ✅ Generic CAT now wired at the **top level** — see below. The `rig_a` copies stay reserved for multi-rig. |

**Generic serial CAT backend wired ✅ Done (2026-06-29).** `cat_backend = "generic"` (top-level
`[radio]`, with `serial_port` + `rig_file`) now drives the previously-unreachable `GenericSerialCat`
(FF-13). `RigctldController` gained a real `CatController` impl (the trait doc had claimed it); the
daemon holds a `CatBackend` enum (rigctld | generic) behind `Option`, selected by
`server::build_cat_controller`, gated by the daemon `generic-serial` feature (Unix). Meter polling
stays rigctld-only (separate connection). Tests: `cat_backend_tests` (none → no controller; generic
without a rig file → no controller, no panic).

The field docs + TOML template now mark these accurately so the config no longer looks wired when
it isn't; the underlying multi-rig refactor remains tracked here.

### Signed handshake wired into the daemon connect ✅ Done (2026-06-29)

**Resolved.** The daemon now exchanges the Ed25519 signed handshake over RF on connect:
`ConnectPeer` signs a `ConReq` (with the station's grid) and transmits it SAR-fragmented (the
~530 B frame exceeds the 255 B modem-frame cap); the responder reassembles it in
`process_received_bytes`, verifies it, replies with a signed `ConAck` (also SAR-fragmented), and
records the proven peer identity; the initiator verifies the `ConAck` against its in-flight
`ConReq` and records the verified peer. The verified grid is stamped onto the in-flight ADIF QSO
(taking precedence over the `[logbook.peer_grids]` config fallback), so **logbook item B (peer
GRIDSQUARE from the handshake) is now delivered**. Station key from `[station] identity_key_path`
(default `~/.config/openpulse/identity.key`, auto-generated). New `ControlEvent::PeerVerified`;
30 s CONACK timeout. Grid is a `skip_serializing_if`-empty field on `ConReq`/`ConAck` so legacy
zero-grid frames stay byte-identical. Tests: `handshake_rf_tests` (6, daemon) +
`handshake::tests` grid coverage (3, core). The exchange is **additive** to the existing local
trust eval — `begin_secure_session` still runs; the connection upgrades to "verified" on CONACK.

Original finding (2026-06-27), for history:

Investigating "peer GRIDSQUARE from the handshake" surfaced a larger gap: the Ed25519 signed
handshake (`ConReq`/`ConAck` in `openpulse-core/src/handshake.rs`) is a **tested library primitive
that the daemon never exchanges**. `ModemEngine::begin_secure_session` (the `ConnectPeer` path) is a
**local trust evaluation** (`evaluate_handshake` over the provided params) — it does not send a
`ConReq` or verify a peer's `ConAck` over RF. `ConReq`/`ConAck` are referenced only by the
handshake library + its tests, nowhere in the daemon.

Consequences:
- No authenticated peer identity (or grid) is exchanged on air in normal daemon operation — the
  peer callsign comes from the local `ConnectPeer` argument, not a verified handshake.
- "Peer GRIDSQUARE from the handshake" (logbook richer-fields item B) is therefore **blocked** on
  first wiring the signed `ConReq`/`ConAck` exchange into the daemon connect flow — a substantial
  feature, not a field add. Adding a grid field to the unused primitive now would be a new
  "defined-but-not-consumed" gap, so it was deliberately NOT done.
- Interim for the logbook grid: the `[logbook.peer_grids]` config map (shipped, item A).

(This "real fix" — wiring the over-the-air signed `ConReq`/`ConAck` exchange into the daemon connect
flow — was **delivered in v0.3.0**, PR #584; see the "Resolved" note at the top of this section.)

### Automatic ADIF logbook (opt-in) ✅ Shipped

**Done.** `crates/openpulse-core/src/adif.rs` (`AdifRecord` + ADIF 3.1.4 rendering, band mapping)
and `crates/openpulse-daemon/src/logbook.rs` (`Logbook` — `begin_qso` on connect, `end_qso`
appends on disconnect) with `[logbook]` config (`enabled`, `adif_path`, `peer_grids`) and runtime
`SetLogbook` parity across daemon/CLI/panel. The worked-station `GRIDSQUARE` comes from the verified
handshake when available (see the handshake item above), falling back to the `[logbook.peer_grids]`
config map. Original design notes below for history.

A station logbook that records each contact in **ADIF** (Amateur Data Interchange Format) so logs
import into standard logging software / LoTW / eQSL. Opt-in via a new `[logbook]` config section
(`enabled = false` default, `adif_path = "~/.local/share/openpulse/openpulse.adi"`).

- **QSO source:** derive a record per completed contact, not per frame — keyed on the
  handshake / `ConnectPeer` peer callsign (CONREQ identity), with frequency/band from CAT
  (`RigctldController`), `mode` from the active modem mode, UTC start/end timestamps, and
  RST/SNR from the rate-policy SNR estimate. Distinct from `TxSessionLog` (per-frame regulatory
  audit) — the logbook is per-QSO.
- **Fields:** `CALL`, `QSO_DATE` / `TIME_ON` / `TIME_OFF`, `BAND` / `FREQ`, `MODE` / `SUBMODE`,
  `RST_SENT` / `RST_RCVD`, `STATION_CALLSIGN`, `MY_GRIDSQUARE` / `GRIDSQUARE`, `COMMENT`
  (effective rate / final speed level).
- **Surface:** `[logbook]` config toggle + a control command with CLI/panel parity (per the audit
  above). Append-on-QSO-complete; must never block the modem path.
- **Open questions:** ADIF version (3.1.x), how to map HPX modes to ADIF `MODE` / `SUBMODE`
  (a custom `DYNAMIC` vs. per-mode), and whether to also log FreeDV / Winlink sessions.

### Weak-signal symbol-diversity mode ❌ Measured, not shipped (#864, PR #869)

**Verdict (2026-07-14): do not ship the rung — the diversity gain does not survive its own PAPR.**
Measured per the "measure the floor first" rule (Fable design review → kill-first ρ=0 ideal bound →
real-waveform net). The ρ=0 *ideal* (perfect decorrelation, no PAPR) cleared the ≥2 dB kill-gate
(~4–4.5 dB on good_f1), but the **real** dual-carrier waveform (same bits on FC±375 Hz, S=750 Hz minimax
spacing, one Watterson channel) gives only ~1 dB (BPSK250) to ~2.6 dB (BPSK31) matched-average-power gain
at the 0.5 crossing, and the two-tone beat's **ΔPAPR = +2.6 dB** (paid as reduced average power on a
PEP-limited PA) consumes almost all of it → **net on-air ≈ break-even**, at 2× the occupied bandwidth.
The ladder's existing levers dominate: dropping the baud (~6–7 dB) and free HARQ time-diversity. Full
analysis: `docs/dev/research/weak-signal-diversity-measurement.md`; reproducible measurements
`crates/openpulse-modem/tests/diversity_upper_bound.rs` + `diversity_real_waveform.rs`; the reusable
`ModemEngine::combine_and_decode_llrs` seam remains. Revisit only for a **constant-envelope** diversity
waveform (no two-tone PAPR) if the ~1 dB high-reliability net + 2× bandwidth ever become worth it.

**Original implementation-scoping notes (2026-07-14; superseded by the verdict above).** Prototyping the
plugin surfaced why this is a *measured* research task, not a quick add:
- **The gain is fading-only and must be proven coded.** Splitting power across two carriers then combining
  is a **wash on AWGN** (diversity buys diversity, not coding gain) — so the deliverable is a **coded
  frame-success** gain on a **frequency-selective / fading** channel, established with a Watterson bake-off
  (and a chosen carrier separation Δf ≥ the coherence bandwidth so the two branches decorrelate). Per the
  repo's rule ("measure the floor delta first / an uncoded-BER win is not a win"), no rung ships without
  that number.
- **BPSK's soft path is differential (NRZI).** Summing the two branches' LLRs is valid MRC (LLRs add for
  independent looks), but the hard-decode byte-packing and the soft-FEC / HARQ-calibration interaction
  need the same care as the recent `llr_calibration` fixes — this is exactly the area the codebase keeps
  getting subtly wrong.
- **A new mode needs a justified ladder rung** (which SL / profile) — a mode-scope decision measured
  against the neighbour, not asserted.
- Sketch that works: dual-carrier BPSK at `fc ± baud` (Δ = 2×baud makes the carriers integrate-and-dump
  orthogonal), soft-LLR-sum combine, reusing `BpskPlugin`. Tracking: **#864**.


Flagged from the FreeDV/codec2 reference pass (see `docs/dev/research/references.md` →
*CE-SSB and polar-SSB transmit conditioning*). FreeDV **700D** transmits each carrier's
symbol **twice** across the band ("frequency diversity"), so the receiver combines two
independent fading realisations before slicing. This is a distinct SNR lever from FEC
(it buys diversity, not coding gain) and would give the ladder a rung **below** its
current SL floor for deep-fade / very-weak-signal HF.

- **Idea:** an optional lowest-rate mode (candidate `SL1`-adjacent) that repeats each
  data symbol on a second, band-separated carrier and does maximal-ratio (or equal-gain)
  combining at the receiver before demodulation — trading throughput for a few dB of
  fading margin the FEC alone doesn't provide.
- **Fit:** slots naturally under the OFDM path (per-subcarrier repetition + combine) or
  as a dedicated diversity waveform; complements, does not replace, the RS/LDPC/soft-FEC
  stack.
- **Open questions:** carrier spacing for decorrelated fading vs. occupied bandwidth;
  combine metric (MRC needs per-carrier SNR estimates from the pilots); where it sits on
  the `RateAdapter` ladder (a true sub-floor rung vs. a separate "weak-signal" profile);
  and whether the gain over just dropping to BPSK31 + soft-FEC is worth the complexity.
- **Status:** unscheduled; no target date. Parked here so the diversity lever isn't lost.

### Reference-derived candidate backlog (software-defined modem study, 2026-07-14)

From studying RFnexus/modem73, chrissnell/omnimodem, and chrissnell/graywolf
(`docs/dev/research/references.md`). Requirements REQ-AGC-01, REQ-PTT-01/02/03, REQ-WSIG-01, REQ-RX-01,
REQ-DEV-01 in `requirements.md`. **Re-implemented independently — no code copied.** Priority order:

1. **REQ-PTT-01 — transmitter-release RAII guard (unkey-on-Drop). ✅ Shipped (2026-07-14).**
   `SharedPtt::keyed` → `PttKeyGuard` (Drop releases, including on panic/unwind); the five automatic-TX
   sites in `server.rs` converted. Bounds an unexpected key-down to the current scope instead of ≤180 s.
Build order revised per the 2026-07-14 Fable design review (see traceability):

1. **REQ-PTT-02 + REQ-PTT-03 — CM108 USB-HID + GPIO PTT backends ✅ Track complete.**
   - **REQ-PTT-02 CM108 ✅ Shipped (#875).** `openpulse_radio::Cm108Ptt` — a plain 5-byte `/dev/hidrawN`
     write (**no `hidapi`/C dep**, always-compiled, unit-tested in default CI), sysfs auto-detect (vendor
     `0x0d8c`), `[modem] ptt_device`/`ptt_gpio` config + `cm108` selector arm in the daemon and CLI.
   - **REQ-PTT-03 GPIO ✅ Shipped.** `openpulse_radio::GpioPtt` over `gpiocdev` (pure Rust, `gpio` feature)
     behind a mockable `PttLine` trait — the assert/release/active-low logic is fully unit-tested with a
     mock in default CI; `chip:line[:active_low]` spec in `ptt_device`; `gpio` selector arm in daemon+CLI.
   - **Daemon `rts`/`dtr` gap fixed:** the daemon now supports serial PTT (behind its new `serial` feature)
     using `ptt_device` as the port path, instead of silently disabling it.
2. **REQ-DEV-01 — hotplug-safe audio device identity. ✅ Shipped.** `openpulse_core::audio::resolve_device`
   — a pure match ladder (exact → ALSA `CARD=` token → case-insensitive substring → error-on-ambiguity),
   unit-tested in default CI (reorder + rename cases), wired into `CpalBackend::open_input`/`open_output`
   via `select_cpal_device`. The `[audio] device` config field is now a hotplug-safe selector.
   Deferred enhancement: a sysfs vendor/product/serial stable-id (omnimodem-style) as an opt-in later.
3. **REQ-RX-01 — simultaneous multi-mode receive. ✅ Shipped.** `openpulse_daemon::monitor::MonitorRuntime`
   — a throwaway `ModemEngine` (all CPU plugins) that tries each configured mode against every completed
   capture burst via `decode_burst`, independent of the live RX session; `reset_afc` isolates modes.
   Off by default (`[monitor] enabled`/`modes`), emits `ControlEvent::MonitorFrame { mode, bytes }` per
   decode; no engine-RX changes (the rx-tick hands the same burst it already assembled). Note:
   `decode_burst` only scans the acquisition lead-in, so the contract is one-mode-per-burst decoded
   correctly across a mixed-mode stream — not two overlapping modes in one buffer.
4. **REQ-AGC-01 — AGC config gate + acceptance test. ✅ Shipped** (the AGC itself shipped earlier in PRs
   #583/#699/#700/#826; the "we have no AGC" claim was stale). Added the `[modem] agc_enabled` (+
   `agc_target_rms`/`agc_bandwidth`/`agc_max_gain_db`) TOML gate applied at daemon startup like the notch,
   and the amplitude-sweep acceptance test (`agc_amplitude_sweep.rs`) documenting that decode is
   level-invariant with AGC on *or* off across ×0.1–×3.0, and that the AGC runs (tripwire) + tracks level
   (metering). The hard-limiter-correlator option is **rejected** (constant-envelope, incompatible with
   soft-LLR; acquisition already amplitude-invariant).
5. **REQ-WSIG-01 — robust narrowband weak-signal waveform. ✅ Measured — ideal-bound gate PASSED; production
   build is a scheduled multi-PR effort.** The **constant-envelope non-coherent 16-GFSK** candidate (31.25
   baud, 500 Hz, reusing the JS8 tone synth + Goertzel detector + engine union decode) was baked off vs
   BPSK31 on Watterson (`crates/openpulse-modem/tests/mfsk_subfloor_bound.rs`, ideal genie-sync bound). It
   **cleared the pre-registered ≥5 dB ideal gate**: ~5 dB on moderate_f1, **BPSK31 fails entirely on
   poor_f1** (fast fade breaks coherent carrier tracking) while 16-GFSK crosses ~0 dB, no good_f1
   regression, and **ΔPAPR = −1.45 dB (a credit)** — the opposite of #864. AWGN sanity holds (MFSK doesn't
   win on AWGN). Full analysis: `docs/dev/research/robust-narrowband-measurement.md`. **Two conditions
   govern the production ship** (a positive waveform number alone doesn't settle it): (a) an **MFSK-class
   ACK channel** — FSK4-ACK dies far above the candidate's floor, so as an ARQ rung it needs its return
   link there too, else it's broadcast-only; (b) real-sync erosion (~2–3 dB, budgeted — moderate stays
   positive, poor is unbounded) + HPX session-timer handling for the 16 s frame. Production stages: real-
   sync measurement → `mfsk16` plugin + engine registration → SL1 ladder placement → MFSK ACK → timers.
   **Real-sync measurement DONE (2026-07-14):** added Costas-16 sync + a timing×frequency search + a
   ±25 Hz injected tuning offset, genie column alongside. **Net moderate_f1 gain ~4.2 dB (clears the
   ≥3 dB ship bar); poor_f1 unbounded; erosion genie→real only ~1 dB** (non-coherent acquisition is easy —
   far below #864's 2–3 dB). AWGN sanity holds. **The waveform + acquisition are validated end-to-end; the
   DSP risk is retired.** Remaining ship questions are **operational, not waveform**: the MFSK-class ACK
   channel (the crux) + session timers. Production stages b–e (`mfsk16` plugin + engine + SL1 ladder +
   ACK + timers) remain a scheduled multi-PR build. **PRODUCTION PLUGIN SHIPPED (broadcast-first, per the
   Fable production review): `plugins/mfsk16` (`Mfsk16Plugin`, mode `MFSK16`)** — modulate/demodulate/
   demodulate_soft reuse the validated primitives; self-acquiring (Costas-16 sync + timing×freq search,
   `estimate_afc_hz = None`); a **frame-level-median noise estimator** (Fable's calibration fix over the
   measurement's per-symbol mean) that passes `llr_reliability` on AWGN + Watterson; registered in the
   CLI/daemon/monitor/panel. Usable now as a **robust broadcast/beacon + explicit `--mode MFSK16`** data
   mode. **ROBUST ACK RESOLVED (PR-C, 2026-07-15) → ARQ rung UNBLOCKED.** Two measured findings overturned
   the earlier deferral: (1) the "~0.6 at the data floor" was a **40-trial small-sample artifact** — at 400
   trials the single 40-sym `MFSK16-ACK` decodes **~0.90 (moderate) / ~0.92 (poor) at 0 dB**, argmax ≡
   soft-LLR, right at the bar (with a steep cliff below); (2) the intuitive "longer contiguous + stronger
   code" fix **loses** (worse than baseline at −3 dB — a longer frame accumulates more fade-burst exposure
   than the extra ECC covers), while **K=3 time-spaced copies + a per-copy-LLR union decode** (#694: decode
   each alone, MAP-sum only as fallback — *not* energy-summing) clears **0.99–1.00 at 3 dB below the floor**
   on both channels, `genie ≈ real`, wrong-locks = 0, and **needs no frequency hop** (stays 500 Hz).
   **Shipped:** the reusable validated primitive `openpulse_core::ack::decode_ack_from_llr_copies` + the
   measurement (`plugins/mfsk16/src/robust_ack.rs`: fast gates + ignored sweep/reconciliation).
   **ARQ INTEGRATION — STAGED (greenlit 2026-07-15; Fable design review verified against source).** The naive
   "each side keys on its own rung" ACK dispatch deterministically **desyncs at every SL1 boundary** (the ISS
   can't know the IRS's waveform on a failed decode — the "drop to SL1" recommendation rides a waveform the
   ISS isn't listening for), so the ISS must **union-listen**. **PR-1 (core) SHIPPED:** SL1 = MFSK16/Rs rung
   in `hpx_hf` (bottom, floor `None`, ceiling 5.0 → climb to SL2); `transmit_ack_mfsk16_k3` (K=3, 0.5 s gaps,
   one keying) + `transmit_ota_ack` dispatch (K=3 when the ACK recommends SL1, else FSK4) + union-listen
   `receive_ota_ack_within` (per-read FSK4 + energy-onset K=3 slot-union, first-success) + mode-scaled
   `ota_ack_timeout_ms` (9 s sub-floor / 4 s else) + MFSK16 `estimate_snr_db` (avoids the M2M4 self-sealing
   SL1 trapdoor); daemon swaps the 2 ACK call sites. Tests: `mfsk16_arq_subfloor` (K=3 round-trip /
   union-listen-accepts-FSK4 / non-sub-floor fast path) + `snr_estimate`. **PR-2 (guardrails) SHIPPED:**
   payload-capacity gate — `ota_tx_for_payload` bumps a body over one MFSK16 RS block (cap = 209 B) off SL1
   to the next rung that carries multi-block (decodable whenever the peer confirms ≥ there), instead of
   hard-erroring and silently dropping; HARQ-gate admission for MFSK16+Rs **with** its measured diversity
   gate (`mfsk16_harq_diversity`: combining two moderate_f1 attempts beats a single one); climb-out/trapdoor
   test (`subfloor_sl1_climbs_back_out_when_snr_recovers`: SL1 → SL2 once SNR clears the 5 dB ceiling). The
   daemon ACK-seam swap is regression-checked green by the existing `ota_ladder_steps` twin test (fast path).
   **END-TO-END VALIDATED (CI gate):** `twin_daemon_bridge::subfloor_sl1_message_crosses_with_k3_ack` — two
   real daemons pinned at SL1, a message crosses via a `mode == "MFSK16"` data frame and B's K=3 MFSK16-ACK
   that A recovers by union-listening (A's `OtaStatus` reports `tx_mode == "MFSK16"`). The 17 s frame is 17 s
   of *samples* over the non-real-time loopback bridge, so it runs in ~1 s. The snd-aloop real-audio rig
   validates the same over a sound card: `OTA=1 OTA_LOCK=SL1 PROFILE=hpx_hf ./scripts/run-twin-station-audio.sh`
   (new `OTA_LOCK` knob). **Deferred (needs mid-test channel control):** the *dynamic* entry+exit boundary —
   a live deep fade dropping the ladder to SL1 then recovering. Shipped waveform state (`MFSK16`
   broadcast/beacon + explicit mode) stands.
