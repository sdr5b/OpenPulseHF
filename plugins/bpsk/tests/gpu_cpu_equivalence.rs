//! GPU-vs-CPU equivalence on inputs the receiver actually sees.
//!
//! The in-crate equivalence tests (`gpu_demodulate_matches_cpu`, the two kernel
//! ones) compare a **clean, noiseless, perfectly-aligned** frame: modulate two
//! bytes, demodulate them back. They run, they assert, and they pass — while the
//! GPU path costs `openpulse-linksim`'s rate-ladder gate its climb (#1080:
//! passes in 14 s with `OPENPULSE_GPU_DISABLE=1`, fails in 54 s without).
//!
//! A pristine waveform is the easiest case that exists. These tests add the two
//! things a real receiver always has — noise and a carrier offset — and compare
//! decode outcomes over a seed sweep, so a divergence that only appears off the
//! ideal operating point has somewhere to show up.
//!
//! Requires `--features gpu` and a working adapter; skips loudly otherwise, and
//! the skip is asserted against rather than silently reported as success.
