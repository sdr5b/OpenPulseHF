//! The preamble parameterisation must not move a single shipped bit.
//!
//! Before #1062's vetting work the preamble sequence was written out three times
//! — the Hann/RRC modulator, the GPU modulator, and the demodulator's expected
//! table — with no shared constant, so a wire-format edit could silently
//! desynchronise one end from the other (the playbook's one-sided rebuild, which
//! fails with "invalid magic" rather than a compile error).
//!
//! These tests pin that the parameterised seam, fed the shipped sequence,
//! reproduces the shipped path exactly. That is what makes the vetting harness
//! fidelity-by-construction instead of fidelity-by-comment (verification rule 5).
