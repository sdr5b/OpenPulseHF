//! BPSK demodulator.
//!
//! The demodulation pipeline is:
//!
//! ```text
//! audio samples
//!   → multiply by I/Q reference carriers
//!   → matched-filter (half-Hann w_tail) integration per symbol period
//!   → timing search over [−n/2, n) (brute-force energy maximisation)
//!   → differential phase detection (NRZI decode)
//!   → bits → bytes
//! ```
//!
//! ## Symbol timing
//!
//! The modulator prepends [`PREAMBLE_SYMS`] symbols with alternating phases
//! (+1, −1, +1, …).  The demodulator scans every timing offset from half a
//! symbol before the slice to one symbol into it (`[−n/2, n)`, #1438), picks
//! the offset that maximises the demodulated preamble energy, and uses it for
//! the rest of the frame. The hard path also decodes at the best offset inside
//! `[0, n)` when that differs, and lets the FEC/CRC choose.
//!
//! ## Phase ambiguity
//!
//! Differential detection removes the 180° absolute-phase ambiguity that
//! would otherwise require carrier-phase recovery.

    //!
    //! **The issue body's hypothesis is dead and this does not test it.** The body proposes that
    //! preamble-locked timing "sits a quarter symbol off for stretches"; the thread retired that on
    //! 2026-09-13, and the structural reason is decisive — this path has NO timing tracking. One lock
    //! per frame (`find_timing_offset_with_expected`), then fixed slicing at `offset + k*n`. The
    //! channel moves under a fixed lock; nothing drifts.
    //!
    //! **The live mechanism is a tie-break.** Where the composite response at the carrier collapses,
    //! the symbol response loses its DC term, so every NO-FLIP pair yields `r_k ~ 0` — an exact
    //! decision tie — while flips still yield large `r`. The backward substitution fills each tied
    //! slot with `-beta * a'_{k+1}`, so consecutive fills ALTERNATE IN SIGN and a differential
    //! detector reads alternation as flips. Every no-flip bit inside the dip decodes as 1.
    //!
    //! **Prediction:** in dips the hard path's errors concentrate on true bit 0 (-> 1.0) and sit at
    //! **1/3 on bit 1** — a flip decodes correctly only when the NEXT bit is also a flip, so
    //! err|b1 = 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3. The soft path (no cancellation) is symmetric.
    //!
    //! An earlier version of this comment said "~0.0 on bit 1", which is wrong and would have made a
    //! measured 0.35 read as a MISS when it is the prediction hit. Corrected in review.
    //! **Falsifier:** in-dip hard errors NOT concentrated on bit 0.
    //!
    //! In-crate because `demodulate_iq`, `cancel_crossfade_isi` and `differential_decode` are private.
    //! A probe needing non-public access is a unit test, never an exported accessor — and it must not
    //! RE-IMPLEMENT the chain, so `the_composed_arm_matches_the_shipped_demodulator` asserts byte
    //! identity against `bpsk_demodulate` in the DEFAULT run.
