# OpenPulseHF

A plugin-based HF/VHF/UHF software modem and protocol stack written in Rust.

OpenPulseHF is a multi-crate Rust workspace providing a full digital communications stack —
from DSP primitives and adaptive rate profiles through ARDOP/KISS TNC interfaces,
B2F/Winlink protocol support, QSY frequency agility, mesh networking, and post-quantum
key exchange. The plugin architecture lets modulation modes be added without touching
the core modem engine. All tests run against a deterministic loopback backend; no audio
hardware is required to build or test.

## Status

**📘 v0.16.0 released (18th of July '26)** — [release notes](https://github.com/dc0sk/OpenPulseHF/releases/tag/v0.16.0). Documentation and test-integrity release; the modem is unchanged and interoperates with v0.15.0 exactly as before. Ships **[the OpenPulseHF book](docs/openpulse-book.md)** — a complete technical account for operators, electronic engineers and software developers at once (waveforms and ladders, the physics and DSP with their mathematics, cryptography, architecture, and twelve copy-pasteable scenarios) — plus a **rewritten [operator manual](docs/openpulse-manual.md)**. Both came out of a multi-agent consistency audit whose verdict was that the docs were *broadly truthful about capability but poorly maintained about status*. The worst finding was here in this README: it advertised "Winlink Type C wire-compatible" **148 lines below the v0.15.0 banner retracting that exact claim**. The second worst was in the tests — two acceptance rows named for "loopback correctness" never called the receive path, four of them literally `let _ok = true; assert!(_ok);`. Those now do real AWGN round-trips with a below-floor control, and six more gates in the same class were fixed. Also: a draft **[1.0 criteria](docs/dev/project/release-1.0-criteria.md)** doc, because "pre-1.x" was previously undefinable. *Prior release (v0.15.0): Winlink stack hardening — one live DoS, an aggregate decompression cap, and per-operation read deadlines (`SO_RCVTIMEO` restarts on every partial read, so it never bounded the operation).*

**v0.4.0 (12th of July '26)** — [release notes](https://github.com/dc0sk/OpenPulseHF/releases/tag/v0.4.0). **JS8-based station discovery + rendezvous** (a native JS8Call-interoperable weak-signal waveform — no JS8Call install — off by default and RX-only until you opt into transmitting) and **direct signed P2P file transfer** over the air (offer/accept, progress, tamper-verified against the peer's key). Plus the signal-chain audit that unlocked the dense high-throughput rungs of the adaptive ladder (OFDM re-seat + HARQ soft-combining).

**v0.3.0 (29th of June '26)** — [release notes](https://github.com/dc0sk/OpenPulseHF/releases/tag/v0.3.0). Headline: the daemon now runs a **signed handshake over the air on connect** — it exchanges and verifies an Ed25519 `ConReq`/`ConAck`, stores the peer's verified callsign + Maidenhead grid, and writes the verified grid to an **automatic ADIF logbook**. Also new: **opt-in ARDOP adaptive ARQ** (making the host `ARQBW`/`ARQTIMEOUT` hints real), a **generic serial CAT backend** for rigs Hamlib doesn't support, a reworked **operator panel** (right-hand controls, full-width waterfall, AGC toggle) with full daemon/CLI/panel control parity, receiver **auto-notch + auto-QSY** on in-band interference, and linksim I/Q constellation views with a `--serve` mode so the panel can attach with no radio.

**v0.2.1 (24th of June '26)** — headline feature: CE-SSB transmit envelope conditioning (per-mode, default-on for the high-PAPR OFDM/SC-FDMA modes). The average-power gain at fixed PEP is confirmed on-air (+1.18 dB on 2 m via an FT-991A), matching the channel-sim prediction; software ACPR and an on-air SDR spectral-mask check show no added splatter on QPSK OFDM (dense OFDM-HOM stays clean at normal data-mode drive). The operator panel now carries a CE-SSB toggle and a tabbed Messages/Event-Log pane.

9th of June '26, the soundsystem bugs have been fixed and validated, now returning to on-air tests.

As of 6th of June '26, I'm  busy with on-air-testing and fixing a lot of bugs and some misconceptions. Mostly related to Linux' soundsystems.

## Why OpenPulseHF?

Several capabilities here are firsts or near-firsts in open-source amateur digital modes:

| Capability | What makes it different |
|---|---|
| **Post-quantum link security** | ML-DSA-44 signing + ML-KEM-768 key encapsulation negotiated in-band. Hybrid mode signs with both Ed25519 and ML-DSA-44 simultaneously. No other open HF modem does this. |
| **SC-FDMA waveform on HF** | Single-Carrier FDMA (the LTE uplink waveform) brought to HF with DFT-CE pilot-aided channel estimation and MMSE equalization. (DFT-spread is the low-PAPR-capable structure; the current frequency-interleaved pilot scheme limits the realized PAPR — see [mode/FEC guide §7](docs/mode-fec-ladder.md).) |
| **64QAM and SCFDMA-64QAM with soft demodulation** | Gray-coded 64QAM with max-log-MAP soft demodulator. Aggressive constellation for VHF/UHF links with proper soft FEC backing. |
| **Pilot-framed carrier recovery** | A single-carrier waveform family (`PILOT-QPSK500`…`PILOT-32APSK500`, up to DVB-S2 32APSK) whose known in-band pilots drive carrier tracking instead of a decision-directed Costas loop — cycle-slip-immune on dense constellations and robust to soundcard sample-rate offset. |
| **LDPC belief propagation** | Real rate-1/2 min-sum belief propagation — not a stub. First open-source HF software modem with working LDPC. |
| **LLR-accumulating ARQ** | Soft LLR values accumulate across retransmissions (PACTOR-style Memory-ARQ), turning each retry into a soft combining gain. |
| **GPU-accelerated DSP** | 6 wgpu compute kernels (BPSK modulate/demodulate, timing search, RRC FIR matched filter, 256-pt FFT, soft LLR demod) accelerating BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 64QAM, and SC-FDMA — all with automatic CPU fallback. See [GPU-accelerated features](#gpu-accelerated-features). |
| **QSY frequency agility** | Ed25519-signed, freshness-stamped QSY_REQ/LIST/VOTE/ACK wire protocol, authenticated to the handshake peer. Initiator and responder roles wired into the daemon; rig CAT control via rigctld. |
| **FreeDV authenticated voice** | Ed25519-signed authentication beacons transmitted via the FreeDV Qt-GUI UDP data port (`openpulse-freedv-auth`); no FreeDV fork required. |
| **CE-SSB conditioning for data modes** | Controlled-Envelope SSB (Hershberger W9GR, QEX 2014) — a voice-SSB technique — applied as an adaptive, per-mode TX conditioner that raises average power at fixed PEP on high-PAPR multicarrier modes (OFDM/SC-FDMA). Confirmed **+1.18 dB on-air**, with software *and* on-air SDR spectral checks showing no added splatter on QPSK OFDM (dense HOM clean at normal data-mode drive). Believed to be the first open-source HF *data* modem to do this. |
| **JS8-based discovery + rendezvous** | When idle, a station QSYs to the band's JS8 calling frequency, participates as a real JS8 station (native 8-GFSK / LDPC(174,87) waveform — not a JS8Call bridge), marks itself with an in-band `@OPULSE` capability hint, and caches other OpenPulse stations. On request it negotiates a working frequency over JS8, QSYs there, and hands off to a native signed HPX session. Off by default; RX-only until the operator opts into TX (§97.221-documented). |
| **Direct P2P file transfer with cryptographic verification** | Send a file to a connected peer over an RF session with an offer/accept handshake, progress, and size-gated auto-accept — plus an inline signed `TransferManifest` + SHA-256 verified against the peer's handshake key, so a tampered or wrong-key file is quarantined with an UNVERIFIED badge. That end-to-end verification is something VarAC's file transfer does not do. |

On-air regulatory validation (spectral mask) has not been completed. Except for the
CE-SSB average-power confirmation above, all tests use loopback and simulated-channel
paths only.

## First-to-market features

Capabilities that are firsts or near-firsts among open-source amateur digital-mode software:

| # | Capability | Evidence / where to look |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Post-quantum in-band handshake** | ML-DSA-44 + ML-KEM-768 negotiated inside the ConReq/ConAck wire frames; Hybrid mode dual-signs with Ed25519 + ML-DSA-44 simultaneously (`crates/openpulse-core/src/pq_handshake.rs`) |
| 2 | **SC-FDMA (LTE uplink waveform) on HF** | DFT-spread OFDM with DFT-CE pilot-aided channel estimation and MMSE equalization (`plugins/scfdma`). DFT-spread is the low-PAPR-capable structure; realizing the full PAPR advantage over OFDM would need a non-interleaved pilot scheme. That redesign (old roadmap FF-14) was dropped in favour of the **OFDM higher-order ladder** as the HF high-throughput path — see [mode/FEC guide §7](docs/mode-fec-ladder.md) |
| 3 | **64QAM and SCFDMA-64QAM soft demodulation** | Gray-coded 64QAM max-log-MAP LLR demodulator; SCFDMA52-64QAM reaching 8 667 bps gross over a 2 kHz slice (`plugins/64qam`, `plugins/scfdma`) |
| 4 | **Working LDPC belief propagation** | Rate-1/2 min-sum BP — not a passthrough stub; wired into `transmit_with_ldpc` / `receive_with_ldpc` in the modem engine (`crates/openpulse-core/src/ldpc.rs`) |
| 5 | **LLR-accumulating Memory-ARQ** | Soft LLR values accumulated across retransmissions (PACTOR-style, `SoftCombiner` in `crates/openpulse-core/src/fec.rs`); HARQ retry/mode policy on sustained NACK (`crates/openpulse-modem/src/harq.rs`, `rate_policy.rs`) |
| 6 | **GPU DSP across 5 modulation families** | 6 wgpu WGSL kernels (BPSK modulate/demodulate, timing search, RRC FIR, 256-pt FFT, soft demod) accelerating BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 64QAM, and SC-FDMA, each with CPU fallback — see [GPU-accelerated features](#gpu-accelerated-features) |
| 7 | **Ed25519-signed QSY frequency agility** (verified against the handshake peer since #1252) | Full initiator + responder state machines wired into the daemon; SNR-ranked channel-list negotiation; rig CAT via rigctld (`crates/openpulse-qsy`) |
| 8 | **Zstd pre-trained compression dictionary** | Dictionary trained on amateur/Winlink traffic patterns; codec in `crates/openpulse-core/src/compression.rs`, exercised by the testmatrix/linksim harnesses — **not** negotiated in the handshake, whose negotiation fields were removed in #1166 because nothing consumed them |
| 9 | **Trust-weighted multi-hop relay with query propagation** | `RelayForwarder` enforces hop limits and suppresses duplicates; `score_route` weights paths by trust level (Verified=4 … Reduced=1); `QueryForwarder` propagates route-discovery requests across nodes (`crates/openpulse-core/src/relay.rs`, `query_propagation.rs`) |
| 10 | **Cross-band full-duplex repeater** | `CrossBandRepeater` runs in a daemon-managed thread; `EnableRepeater`/`DisableRepeater` control commands; trust-policy filtering on forwarded frames (`crates/openpulse-repeater`) |
| 11 | **Mesh broadcast daemon with authenticated beacons** | TTL-limited re-broadcast; (session_id, nonce) duplicate suppression; beacon payloads carry signed peer descriptors where the peer ID *is* the Ed25519 verifying key (`crates/openpulse-mesh`) |
| 12 | **FreeDV frame signing via codec2 data channel** | External shim adding Ed25519 per-frame signatures to FreeDV voice transmissions using the codec2 embedded data channel; no FreeDV fork required |
| 13 | **CE-SSB envelope conditioning for digital waveforms** | Hershberger's Controlled-Envelope SSB (QEX 2014) — long used in *voice* SSB (WDSP/Thetis) — applied here as a per-mode, default-on adaptive TX conditioner for high-PAPR multicarrier *data* modes (OFDM/SC-FDMA). Raises average TX power at fixed PEP: +1.6/+2.7/+3.8 dB in channel-sim (OFDM52 at 2.5/2.0/1.5×rms, zero BER cost) and **+1.18 dB confirmed on-air** (FT-991A, 2 m, 20 W via attenuator); software ACPR **and an on-air SDR spectral-mask check** (SDRplay RSP2pro) both confirm CE-SSB raises average power **without added splatter on QPSK OFDM**; on dense OFDM-HOM it stays clean at normal data-mode drive (the bigger average-power boost there only splatters if the PA's ALC is over-driven). Believed to be the first open-source HF data modem to apply CE-SSB (`crates/openpulse-dsp/src/cessb.rs`, `ModemEngine::cessb_benefits`) |
| 14 | **JS8-based station discovery + rendezvous** | A native JS8 waveform (8-GFSK, 79 symbols, Costas 3×7 sync, LDPC(174,87) — ported from GPL-3.0 JS8Call and validated bit-exact against compiled Boost/Qt5, not a bridge to JS8Call) that lets a station discover peers on the shared JS8 calling frequency via an in-band `@OPULSE` capability hint, then negotiate a working frequency over a 2-message rendezvous and QSY to a native signed HPX session. RX-only by default; all TX gated behind an explicit mode + callsign + ±2 s clock-skew/DCD gates and the §97.221 automatic-control documentation (`plugins/js8`, `crates/openpulse-discovery`) |
| 15 | **Signed-manifest direct P2P file transfer** | Offer/accept file transfer over an RF session (`OPFX` wire protocol, ≤48 KiB blocks over SAR, hybrid OTA-rate + `BlockAck`-bitmap selective retransmit, block-level resume) with an inline signed `TransferManifest` + SHA-256 verified against the peer's CONREQ/CONACK key — verify-fail quarantines the file with an UNVERIFIED badge. Cryptographic end-to-end verification that VarAC's file transfer lacks (`crates/openpulse-filexfer`) |

## Feature tables

### Modulation types

Sorted by occupied bandwidth (the mode-name number is the **baud** rate for
single-carrier modes; SC-FDMA/OFDM are named by data-subcarrier count and span
`total_SCs × 31.25 Hz`). The single-carrier modes also have `-RRC` (α = 0.35,
~+35 % bandwidth) and `-HF` tuning variants not all listed here. The `-RRC`
variants are the operational, carrier-offset-robust ones at 2000 baud: the plain
rectangular `QPSK2000` is registered but **RRC-superseded**, and `8PSK2000` is no
longer advertised at all (#1359) — their crossfade pulse is ISI-limited at 4
samples/symbol, so use `-RRC`.
The `PILOT-*` modes are a pilot-framed single-carrier family: known in-band pilot
symbols drive carrier recovery (cycle-slip-immune, sample-rate-offset-robust)
instead of a decision-directed Costas loop — see the
[pilot-framed waveform](docs/dev/design/hpx-waveform-design.md#pilot-framed-waveform) note.

| 64QAM1000 | `64qam` | 1&nbsp;000 | 6 | 6&nbsp;000 | ~1&nbsp;100 | Single-carrier | |
| OFDM52 | `ofdm` | — | 2 | ~2&nbsp;889 | ~2&nbsp;031 | OFDM (52 SCs, QPSK) | ≡ SCFDMA52 throughput; OFDM trades PAPR for per-SC EQ |
| OFDM52-8PSK | `ofdm` | — | 3 | ~4&nbsp;333 | ~2&nbsp;031 | OFDM (52 SCs, 8PSK) | OFDM higher-order ladder — the HF high-throughput path |

| SCFDMA52-P2 | `scfdma` | — | 2 | ~2&nbsp;889 | ~2&nbsp;031 | SC-FDMA (52 SCs, PN pilots) | **Low-PAPR** SCFDMA52: Zadoff-Chu-phase pilots cut envelope-CCDF PAPR ~2.15 dB (8.85→6.70) at the same geometry/rate **and keep full DFT-CE** (beats the flat-CE SCFDMA52-LP); demonstrator, not in any profile |
| SCFDMA52-LP | `scfdma` | — | 2 | ~3&nbsp;389 | ~2&nbsp;031 | SC-FDMA (61 SCs, localized) | **Low-PAPR** demonstrator (~2 dB lower mean PAPR: 11.9→9.7 — mostly from 4 pilots vs 13, only ~0.5 dB from localization); single-tap flat-channel CE ⇒ AWGN/flat/well-timed **only** (silently mis-decodes on selectivity/tilt/timing error), not in any profile |

| _QPSK9600-RRC_ | `qpsk` | 9&nbsp;600 | 2 | 19&nbsp;200 | ~13&nbsp;000 | Single-carrier + RRC | **Deferred (post-1.0)** — VHF/UHF, needs ≥38.4 kHz Fs |
| _8PSK9600-RRC_ | `psk8` | 9&nbsp;600 | 3 | 28&nbsp;800 | ~13&nbsp;000 | Single-carrier + RRC | **Deferred (post-1.0)** — VHF/UHF, needs ≥38.4 kHz Fs |

Each `PILOT-*` mode above also has a `-RRC` variant (~half the occupied bandwidth) and
`1000` / `2000-RRC` baud rungs — e.g. `PILOT-16QAM1000-RRC` (16QAM, 1000 baud, RRC) — all
selectable by name as fixed modes (`[modem] mode`); the `hpx_pilot*` session profiles were deleted 2026-10-01.

The mode/FEC selection ladder and which combinations are usable on HF is documented in [docs/mode-fec-ladder.md](docs/mode-fec-ladder.md).

### MAC / channel access types
| Mechanism | Where used | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **0.3-persistence CSMA** | `openpulse-modem` | DCD energy check; transmit deferred when channel busy; configurable per `ModemEngine` |
| **DCD energy threshold** | `openpulse-core` (dcd.rs) | RMS energy gate with configurable hold window (default 100 ms); forced-busy override for testing |
| **HPX adaptive session** | `openpulse-core` (hpx.rs) | ACK/NACK-driven speed-ladder state machine; `RateAdapter` with per-level SNR gates and NACK-decrement hysteresis |
| **ARQ retry loop** | `openpulse-modem` (`harq.rs` + `rate_policy.rs`) | LLR-accumulating retransmission loop; mode switching on sustained NACK; configurable retry limit |
| **QSY frequency agility** | `openpulse-qsy` | SNR-ranked channel-list negotiation; initiator transmits QSY_REQ → LIST → VOTE/ACK; responder role wired into daemon receive path |
| **Cross-band repeater** | `openpulse-repeater` | Full-duplex digipeater; configurable trust-policy filter; `EnableRepeater`/`DisableRepeater` daemon commands |
| **Mesh re-broadcast** | `openpulse-mesh` | TTL-limited beacon re-broadcast with (session_id, nonce) duplicate suppression |
| **Multi-hop relay** | `openpulse-core` (relay.rs) | `RelayForwarder` with trust-weighted path scoring; hop-limit enforcement; `score_route`/`select_best_scored_route` |

### Compression types

| Algorithm | Layer | Direction | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LZ4** | Session (in-band) | Both | `lz4_flex`; applied above FEC, not negotiated in the handshake (#1166); fast, good for structured text |
| **Zstd + HPX dictionary** | Session (in-band) | Both | Pre-trained dictionary on amateur/Winlink traffic; best compression ratio |
| **None** | Session (in-band) | Both | Binary payloads that are already compressed |
| **Gzip** | B2F wire (Type D) | Both | `flate2`; Winlink Type D proposal |

Session compression is configured locally, not negotiated in the handshake. **Removed in #1166** (the #1147 wire-format break): nothing consumed the selection — the daemon sent the lists empty and hardcoded `None`/`None` — so the field was a capability claim the station could not back. Session compression itself is unchanged; only the *handshake negotiation of it* is gone.

### ARQ types

| Type | Crate / module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Stop-and-wait ARQ** | `openpulse-modem` (engine.rs) | Basic per-frame ACK; NACK triggers retransmit of last frame |
| **LLR-accumulating ARQ (Memory-ARQ)** | `openpulse-modem` (`harq.rs` + `rate_policy.rs`) | Soft LLR values accumulated across retransmissions (PACTOR-style); each retry adds soft-combining gain; mode switch on sustained NACK |
| **SAR (Segmentation and Reassembly)** | `openpulse-core` (sar.rs) | 4-byte header (segment_id, fragment_index, fragment_total); max 64 005 bytes per segment; configurable reassembly timeout; duplicate-idempotent |
| **QSY ACK** | `openpulse-qsy` | Ed25519-signed ACK/REJECT frames completing the QSY_REQ → LIST → VOTE → ACK negotiation loop |

### Error correction types

| Algorithm | Crate / module | Code rate | Strength | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

### GPU-accelerated features

All GPU functions return `Option<T>` — `None` triggers automatic CPU fallback. Gated by `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]`; `--no-default-features` builds use CPU paths throughout.

| Feature | Kernel | Crate / file | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BPSK modulation** | `bpsk_modulate.wgsl` | `openpulse-gpu` / `bpsk-plugin` | GPU symbol mapping and carrier generation (`bpsk_modulate_gpu`) |
| **BPSK IQ demodulation** | `bpsk_demodulate.wgsl` | `openpulse-gpu` / `bpsk-plugin` | Parallel IQ correlation across all sample offsets (`bpsk_iq_demod_gpu`) |
| **Timing-offset search** | `timing_search.wgsl` | `openpulse-gpu` / `bpsk-plugin` | Symbol-timing offset search via parallel energy integration |
| **RRC FIR matched filter** | `rrc_fir.wgsl` | `openpulse-gpu` | Causal RRC pulse-shaping/matched filter (`gpu_rrc_fir`); wired into the RRC paths of BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, and 64QAM |
| **256-pt FFT / IFFT** | `fft256.wgsl` | `openpulse-gpu` | Cooley-Tukey radix-2 DIT; one workgroup per symbol; shared-memory in-place butterfly |
| **Batch FFT (SC-FDMA hard demod)** | `fft256.wgsl` (batched) | `scfdma-plugin` | All per-symbol FFTs in one `gpu_fft256_batch` call; CPU DFT-CE + MMSE + demap; covers the QPSK/8PSK/16QAM/32QAM/64QAM SC-FDMA variants |
| **Batch FFT (SC-FDMA soft demod)** | `fft256.wgsl` (batched) | `scfdma-plugin` | Same batch dispatch; CPU DFT-CE + MMSE + LLR; all SC-FDMA constellations |
| **64QAM soft demodulation** | `rrc_fir.wgsl` + `soft_demod.wgsl` | `64qam-plugin` | GPU RRC matched filter + batched max-log-MAP LLR (`gpu_soft_demod`) |
| **8PSK soft demodulation** | `rrc_fir.wgsl` + `soft_demod.wgsl` | `psk8-plugin` | GPU RRC matched filter + batched Gray-coded LLR (`gpu_soft_demod`) |

### Adaptive rate profiles

Two session profiles, both on the single `hpx_hf` rate ladder, driven by ACK/NACK feedback
and per-level SNR floor/ceiling gates:

| Profile | SL range | Top mode | Occupied BW | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fast` (default) | SL1–SL14 | OFDM52-64QAM + LDPC r≈8/9 | up to ≈2031 Hz | Good conditions, a 2.4 kHz SSB filter, a linear PA |
| `robust` | SL1–SL6 | QPSK250-D | ≤500 Hz | Poor conditions or limited gear (narrow filters, small or non-linear PAs); single-carrier, all coded |

`robust` is the same ladder capped at SL6, so a `fast` and a `robust` station interoperate; the
robust side never climbs past SL6. Other profile names are rejected with the list of valid
names. Modes from the earlier profiles remain selectable as fixed modes (`[modem] mode`).
The ARDOP TNC floors its adaptive ladder at SL2 (it has no MFSK16).

### Protocol and interfaces

- **ARDOP-compatible TCP TNC** (`openpulse-tnc`) — Pat-compatible command set;
  GRIDSQUARE, ARQBW, ARQTIMEOUT, CWID, SENDID, PING
- **KISS/AX.25 TNC** (`openpulse-kisstnc`) — full byte stuffing, AX.25 UI frames
- **B2F/Winlink** — ISS and IRS roles, FC/FS/Ff/Fq frames, Gzip (Type D) compression; Type C/LZHUF is unsupported and inbound proposals are rejected
- **Direct TCP Winlink CMS gateway** (`openpulse-gateway`) — no TNC bridge needed
- **QSY frequency agility** — Ed25519-signed wire codec; initiator and responder session
  state machines; SNR-ranked channel selection; rig CAT via rigctld
- **Mesh broadcast daemon** — TTL-limited re-broadcast with duplicate suppression
- **Cross-band repeater** — configurable digipeater with trust-policy filtering
- **Multi-hop relay** — trust-weighted path scoring; hop-limit enforcement; duplicate
  suppression; `RelayForwarder` and `QueryForwarder` for query propagation

### Security and identity

- **Ed25519** handshake signing + transfer manifest signing/verification
- **ML-DSA-44 + ML-KEM-768** post-quantum handshake — Hybrid (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-44) and PQ-only modes
- **Three trust profiles**: Permissive, Balanced, Strict — configurable per deployment
- **PKI service** — Ed25519 trust-bundle signing with PostgreSQL persistence
- **Signed peer descriptors** — self-authenticating identity; peer ID is the verifying key bytes
- **FreeDV frame signing** (`crates/openpulse-freedv-auth`) — Ed25519 signatures over the codec2 embedded data channel; authenticates voice transmissions without modifying FreeDV itself

### Channel simulation

- **Watterson HF fading** — Good F1/F2, Moderate, Poor profiles; Doppler-shaping filter
- **Gilbert-Elliott burst error** — configurable state machine; AWGN and burst modes
- **QRN/QRM/QSB/Chirp** — broadband noise, interference, slow fading, frequency drift
- DCD energy threshold and 0.3-persistence CSMA channel access

### Filtering and signal enhancement

Options that reduce out-of-band emissions, suppress spectral sidelobes, improve
receiver sensitivity, or raise transmit power efficiency.

Two different things are called "sidelobe" below and they are not
interchangeable: **spectral** sidelobes are out-of-band emissions, shaped by the
pulse (Hann / CosineOverlap / RRC); **autocorrelation** sidelobes are the
peak-sidelobe ratio of a sync sequence, which governs onset placement and is a
property of the preamble.  A pulse shape does nothing for the second and a sync
sequence does nothing for the first.

The pulse-shape and FEC rows are per-mode selectable.  The channel-estimation and
equalization rows are **intrinsic** to their waveforms, not options.  Preambles are
**hardcoded per plugin** and cannot be selected at all.

| Technique | Where | Sidelobe / benefit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CE-SSB envelope conditioning** (`openpulse_dsp::cessb`) | TX; high-PAPR multicarrier (OFDM/SC-FDMA), default-on | +1.6/+2.7/+3.8 dB avg power at fixed PEP (2.5/2.0/1.5×rms); negligible OOB regrowth | Look-ahead peak-stretcher; gated by `cessb_benefits` (no-op on single-carrier/BPSK); +1.18 dB confirmed on-air; panel "CE-SSB" toggle + `SetCessb` control |
| **Half-Hann overlapping crossfade** (`PulseShape::Hann`) | All single-carrier modes (default) | ~−32 dB first sidelobe | 50 % symbol overlap; no ISI at SNR > 3 dB; CPU path only |
| **Cosine overlap** (`PulseShape::CosineOverlap`) | Single-carrier alternative | ~−32 dB; null-to-null BW ≈ 2×Rs | Lower spectral leakage than rectangular; GPU-compatible |
| **Root Raised Cosine (SRRC) FIR** (`PulseShape::Rrc`) | `-RRC` mode suffix (BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 64QAM) | ~−35 dB OOB; excess BW = 35 % | α = 0.35 rolloff; taps configurable; ISI-free by matched-filter design |
| **Sync sequences** (`openpulse_dsp::preamble`) | **Library only — see note** | Barker-11 PSL −13 dB; Barker-13 −17 dB; PN-31/63 near-ideal; Zadoff-Chu-64 CAZAC | `PreambleType` + `PreambleSpec` + `PreambleDetector`. **No shipping mode uses Barker or ZC**, and `PreambleDetector` has no production caller; `pilot-plugin` is the only consumer and uses **PN-63 cycled to 48 chips** (`PREAMBLE_SYMBOLS`), which does not preserve the m-sequence autocorrelation. Corrected 2026-08-07 — this table previously claimed Barker was "used for frame timing acquisition". |
| **Shipping preambles** | Hardcoded per plugin | see `#1062` | BPSK: 32-symbol period-4 alternating run (`preamble_bits`). QPSK: designed 16-symbol sequence. Pilot: truncated PN-63. Their autocorrelation and time-bandwidth limits are the subject of [#1062](https://github.com/dc0sk/OpenPulseHF/issues/1062). |
| **DFT-CE pilot-aided channel estimation** | SC-FDMA (all SCFDMA modes) | Removes multipath phase rotation | DFT-domain CE on pilot subcarriers; combines with MMSE |
| **MMSE equalization** | SC-FDMA | Suppresses inter-subcarrier interference | Per-subcarrier minimum mean-square error; requires DFT-CE |
| **LS channel estimation** | OFDM (OFDM16 / OFDM52) | Least-squares pilot tap estimation | Per-symbol LS CE → ZF equalization |
| **ZF equalization** | OFDM | Removes pilot-estimated channel distortion | Per-subcarrier zero-forcing; follows LS-CE |
| **LMS/DFE adaptive equalizer** | BPSK-RRC demod path | Residual ISI suppression | Supervised preamble training → decision-directed; `crates/openpulse-dsp` |
| **Gardner timing error detector** | BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 64QAM | Symbol clock recovery | Symbol-rate TED; feeds symbol timing interpolator. **Not** the PILOT family, which is single-carrier but recovers timing from its pilots instead. |
| **PLL carrier phase tracking** | BPSK / QPSK / 8PSK | Phase noise rejection | Phase-locked loop updated per symbol; `crates/openpulse-dsp` |
| **AFC IQ-squaring estimator** | BPSK (all rates) | Frequency offset correction ±baud/4 | Tracking range: ±7.8 Hz (BPSK31) … ±62.5 Hz (BPSK250) |
| **Soft-input FEC (LDPC / Turbo)** | Any mode with `supports_soft_demod()` | Coding gain vs. hard-decision FEC | Requires a plugin that returns genuine LLRs; engine warns if paired with hard-only plugin |

**Rectangular pulse spectrum** for reference: first sidelobes −13 dB; classical full-Hann windowing
improves this to −32 dB at the cost of ISI.  See [`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md) for the
detailed crossfade and ISI analysis.

### Operator interfaces

| Interface | Description |
|---|---|
| **Operator panel** (`openpulse-panel`) | Full **iced** GUI connecting to the daemon control port (TCP/WS): a controls band (connection, PTT, mode/frequency, RF peer, feature toggles, TX-atten/squelch, OTA, QSY), live spectrum + waterfall + rate ladder, and a tabbed lower panel (Additional info / Daemon config / Messages / Event log). Dark/Light/Contrast/System themes; hover tooltips on every control |
| **Twin-station view** (`openpulse-twinview`) | egui both-directions viewer — one window over two daemons; per-station spectrum/waterfall + rate/OTA/HPX readouts, so both link directions show at once |
| **TUI** (`openpulse-tui`) | ratatui terminal UI — HPX state (colour-coded), AFC/rate meters, DCD energy bar, scrollable transitions log |
| **CLI** (`openpulse-cli`) | Full-featured command-line interface: transmit, receive, benchmark, monitor, config init, calibrate (audio/PTT/AFC) |
| **Signal testbench** (`openpulse-testbench`) | egui 4-column live view: TX / channel / mixed / RX; waterfall, spectrum, scatter; 7 channel models; SNR slider |

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Toolchain preflight (required: rustc >= 1.97.1)
./scripts/check-toolchain.sh

# Build (requires libasound2-dev on Linux for the CPAL audio feature)
cargo build --workspace

# Test suite — no audio hardware required
cargo test --workspace --no-default-features

# Lint
cargo clippy --workspace --no-default-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Benchmark regression gate
cargo run -p openpulse-cli --no-default-features -- --backend loopback --log error benchmark run

# Automated mode × channel test matrix (outputs to docs/test-reports/)
cargo run -p openpulse-testmatrix --no-default-features
```

If you are temporarily pinned to an older Rust toolchain, run the fallback core gates to keep CI-relevant coverage for all non-PKI crates:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude pki-tooling --no-default-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --exclude pki-tooling --no-default-features
```

The `--no-default-features` flag disables the CPAL audio backend. All tests must
pass with this flag. Never add tests that require real audio hardware.

### Try it without a radio (demo / first impression)

**No radio, sound card, or station is required for any of this** — it is purely a
rig-less demo to get a first impression of the GUIs and the adaptive modem. None
of it transmits on the air.

```bash
# Two-station ARQ link simulator GUI — fully self-contained: it simulates BOTH
# stations over a virtual HF channel. No radio, daemon, or config needed. Tweak
# the SNR / channel model / mode live and watch the rate ladder adapt.
cargo run -p openpulse-linksim --features gui --bin openpulse-linksim-gui

# Want the operator panel too? The simulator stands in for the daemon — add
# --serve so it speaks the panel control protocol, then connect the panel to it
# (no daemon, radio, or config). Press Run in the simulator so it streams frames.
cargo run -p openpulse-linksim --features "gui,serve" --bin openpulse-linksim-gui -- --serve 127.0.0.1:9000
cargo run -p openpulse-panel   # in another terminal → Connect (default 127.0.0.1:9000)
```

For real on-air operation (sound card / radio, CAT/PTT), build the relevant binary
with `--features cpal` and configure `~/.config/openpulse/config.toml` — see the
on-air test plan in `docs/on-air_testplan.md`.

## Non-GPL interfacing

OpenPulseHF is GPL v3, but several interfaces let non-GPL software interoperate without
GPL obligations.  All of the following sit behind a **process boundary** or a **network
protocol boundary**, which the FSF and courts have consistently held does not trigger
copyleft:

| Interface | Transport | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **ARDOP TNC** | TCP 8515 (cmd) / 8516 (data) | ARDOP ASCII command protocol; Pat, Winlink Express, JS8Call–compatible |
| **KISS/AX.25 TNC** | TCP 8100 | Standard KISS framing; compatible with Xastir, YAAC, APRX, Linux AX.25 tools |
| **Daemon control port** | NDJSON over TCP 9000 | Full event stream + control commands; operator panel and scripting |
| **Daemon WebSocket** | JSON over WS 9001 | Same protocol as TCP port; browser and Electron clients |
| **PKI REST API** | HTTP/JSON 8080 | Trust-bundle and key-management endpoints; read-only routes unauthenticated |
| **CLI subprocess** | stdin / stdout | NDJSON output; invocation crosses the process boundary |
| **Winlink CMS gateway** | B2F over TCP 8772 | Outbound-only client to `cms.winlink.org`; CMS is proprietary |

Note: **plugins that statically link against `openpulse-core`** are derivative works
and must be GPL-compatible.  The only supported path for proprietary DSP backends is to
run them as a separate process and bridge data through one of the TCP interfaces above.

See [`docs/non-gpl-interfacing.md`](docs/non-gpl-interfacing.md) for the full interface
specifications including wire formats, authentication, and schema references.
