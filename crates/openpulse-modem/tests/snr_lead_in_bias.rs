//! MEASUREMENT for #1142 — how much does burst lead-in depress the rate-control SNR?
//!
//! `ota_decode_and_ack_inner` computes the SNR that drives the receiver's rate decision over the
//! **entire gathered burst** (`self.rx_snr_db(m, &samples.samples)`), lead-in included.
//! `samples.samples` is everything `accumulate_capture` flushed: the frame plus however much
//! pre-frame audio the DCD let through. Lead-in is by definition the part with no signal in it, so
//! including it can only depress the estimate — the question this answers is *by how much*, and
//! whether that is enough to cross a rung boundary in `hpx_hf`.
//!
//! **The comparison scale is taken from the profile, not typed in** (`SessionProfile::hpx_hf`), so
//! a floor change cannot silently invalidate the conclusion drawn here.
//!
//! Two arms:
//!
//! 1. **Synthetic lead, real noise** — a real engine-transmitted frame embedded in the recorded
//!    IC-9700 idle floor at controlled lead lengths. Real noise matters: a digital-silence lead
//!    would understate the bias, because silence is not what depresses an SNR estimate the way band
//!    noise does. (That exact flaw was found in #1139's harness.)
//! 2. **Real capture** — the whole recorded on-air frame capture versus its burst span, located
//!    by energy rather than transcribed. Nothing about it is modelled.
//!
//! Assert-free: it prints tables. Run:
//! `cargo test -p openpulse-modem --no-default-features --test snr_lead_in_bias -- --ignored --nocapture`
