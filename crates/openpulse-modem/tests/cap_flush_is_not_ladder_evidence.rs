//! A cap-flushed burst is not evidence about the rate ladder (#1255).
//!
//! `accumulate_routed` returns `Ok(Some(burst))` for two events that mean opposite things: the
//! carrier dropped (the transmission ended, so the slab is a complete frame) and the accumulator hit
//! its runaway cap (the carrier was **still up**, so the slab is not one transmission at all — a
//! stuck channel, or a frame trailed by a long carrier). The caller could not tell them apart.
//!
//! A failed decode of a capped slab therefore drove `RxOutcome::Failed`, which does two things and
//! only one of them is bounded: the NACK keying is capped by the daemon's NACK budget (`nack_budget.rs`), but
//! the rate controller's **demotion is not** — successive capped slabs walk `recommended_level` down
//! and the next real ACK carries it to the peer.
//!
//! Everything here drives the production capture entry (`accumulate_capture`), because the flush
//! reason only exists there; handing `ota_decode_burst` a hand-built slab cannot reproduce it.
