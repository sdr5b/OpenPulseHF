//! MEASUREMENT for #1118 — what does the phase-2 acquisition pass cost on a busy band?
//!
//! The two-phase design's cost argument is that phase 2 runs only on bursts that are already lost.
//! Adversarial review demolished the *rarity* half of that claim: on a real band every burst that
//! crosses the DCD and is not our own on-frequency traffic fails phase 1 by definition, so phase 2
//! is effectively always-on for everything except what already works. The design ships on the
//! no-regression property instead — and that makes the worst case a number somebody has to measure
//! rather than argue.
//!
//! **The quantity that matters is not seconds, it is the RATIO of CPU time to audio time.** The
//! daemon's rx tick decodes inline on flush, so time spent in the decoder is time not spent reading
//! the capture stream. A ratio at or above 1.0 means the receiver cannot keep up with its own audio
//! and goes deaf while it thinks — which is a different failure from "slow", and the one that loses
//! the *next* frame.
//!
//! Two rows, both from real runs rather than from a compile-time switch:
//!
//! * **busy band** — recorded IC-9700 hot idle, which sits above the adaptive DCD squelch and so
//!   flushes bursts continuously. Nothing decodes, so this is phase 1 + phase 2, the worst case.
//! * **on-frequency frame** — the same audio with a real frame in it. Phase 1 decodes, so phase 2
//!   never runs; this row is the phase-1-only cost, measured the same way.
//!
//! **Run in RELEASE.** #1066 records this host's debug build at ~5x slower, so a debug ratio is a
//! pessimistic bound rather than a prediction — and a machine under load measures the machine
//! (which is why the header prints both the profile and a caveat).
//!
//! Run: cargo test --release -p openpulse-modem --no-default-features --test phase2_cost -- --ignored --nocapture
