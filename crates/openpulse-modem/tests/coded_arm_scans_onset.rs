//! The daemon's CODED decode arm must locate a frame that does not start at sample 0 (#1138).
//!
//! `ota_decode_and_ack_inner` used to make ONE attempt per candidate, at offset 0, on the whole
//! burst, while its uncoded sibling `decode_burst_inner` scanned onsets. The demodulator's timing
//! search spans about one and a half symbol periods (`[−n/2, n)` since #1438; one period, 32
//! samples at BPSK250, when this was written), so a frame a few thousand samples
//! into a burst was undecodable — and that is where real captures put it. On the on-air corpus the
//! coded arm lost every RS-coded frame the CLI path recovered (daemon 1/7 vs CLI 5/7); with the scan
//! it is 5/7, matching the CLI exactly. See `daemon_vs_cli_on_real_captures.rs`.
//!
//! This is the blind-sibling-path archetype: one arm fixed, its twin left behind. The two now share
//! `burst_onset_scan_bounds`, so the geometry cannot drift apart again — but a shared helper is not
//! a gate, because nothing stops a future edit dropping the scan loop from one caller. This is.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT a corpus replay: the corpus is BPSK250-specific and slow, and this must fail for
//! the mechanism (frame not at offset 0) rather than for anything about a particular recording.
