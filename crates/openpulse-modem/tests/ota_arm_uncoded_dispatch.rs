//! Which decode arm the daemon dispatches to decides whether an UNCODED frame can be received.
//!
//! `server::run`'s rx_ticker has two mutually-exclusive arms for a flushed burst: with an OTA
//! session active it calls `ota_decode_burst`, otherwise `decode_burst`. `ota_decode_burst` tries
//! only the current rung's candidates — at most two `(mode, FEC)` pairs (`ota_rate.rs:353`) — each
//! carrying `profile.fec_for(level)`. Under the default `hpx_hf` every rung is coded, so an uncoded
//! frame matches no candidate whatever its mode. The daemon nevertheless transmits uncoded frames on
//! several paths that have nothing to do with the OTA data ladder (station ID, filexfer fragments,
//! handshake CONREQ/CONACK, QSY frames, relay envelopes).
//!
//! Note this is a property of the profile's FEC table, not of profiles in general: `fec_for` is
//! `fec_modes[level].unwrap_or(FecMode::None)` (`profile.rs`), and only `hpx_hf`, `hpx_ofdm_hf` and
//! `hpx_wideband_hd` code every rung — `hpx_modcod` populates the table but leaves SL7 uncoded, and
//! the rest yield uncoded candidates that still only cover the ladder's own modes at the current rung.
//!
//! This isolates the arm as the single variable: ONE burst, gathered through the daemon's own
//! capture entry, decoded both ways. The `decode_burst` cell is the positive control — it proves
//! the burst is intact, correctly framed and locatable, so a failure in the `ota_decode_burst` cell
//! cannot be blamed on chunking, DCD boundaries, the front-end seam or mode mismatch.
