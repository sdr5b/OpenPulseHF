//! The DAEMON's carrier detector must square with the band it is listening to (REQ-DCD-01).
//!
//! **Why this file exists, and why it is not about any mode.** The receive machinery hardened by
//! #1020/#1021/#1039/#1040/#1045/#1049 — `EnergyGate`, the AFC settle, the preamble-correlation
//! veto, the condemnation recovery — lives entirely in the scanning `receive_with_timeout*` family.
//! The shipped daemon calls **none of it**: `server.rs`'s rx tick uses `accumulate_capture` →
//! `decode_burst` / `ota_decode_burst`. Its only frame-start decision is `DcdState`, and that was
//! created with a **fixed** 0.01 RMS squelch.
//!
//! A real band floor walks straight over a constant. The recorded IC-9700 idle capture measures
//! ≈ 0.126 RMS — **12× that squelch** — so on that band the DCD reads permanently busy, the burst
//! never ends on a carrier drop, and it flushes only when it hits the runaway cap. `decode_burst`
//! then scans just the first few acquisition windows of a cap-length buffer of noise.
//!
//! This is the mode-independent half of the problem, which is where it belongs: level, floor and
//! interference are properties of the environment, not of the waveform. Frame *detection* stays
//! per-waveform (codec2 correlates against per-mode templates too); what must be mode-independent is
//! the criterion, and "is the channel busy" is exactly that.
//!
//! Everything here drives the **production entry** (`accumulate_capture`), never the convenience
//! seam — the repo's standing rule for cross-cutting receive behaviour.
