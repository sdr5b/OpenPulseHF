//! #1428 step 1 — the ENGINE-level soft-vs-hard A/B, with real RS and the scrambler.
//!
//! **SINCE #1428's UNION LANDED, THE SECOND COLUMN IS NO LONGER THE CANCELLED ARM.** Its entry,
//! `receive_with_fec_mode(Rs)` → `receive_with_fec`, now decodes BOTH decision arms and keeps the
//! first that RS accepts. So this harness now measures **uncancelled vs union**, not uncancelled vs
//! cancelled, and its "hard"/"H-only" columns are the union's. Expect the union column to be at
//! least the soft column in every cell. A soft-only frame would indicate the soft sign-slice and
//! variant 1 have diverged — nothing pins them bit-identical for BPSK (`hard_variant_conformance`'s
//! I3 skips two-variant plugins) — so treat one as a finding to check, not as noise.
//! The numbers recorded against this harness in the traceability ledger (2026-09-22) predate the
//! union and ARE the cancelled-vs-uncancelled comparison; do not re-run this and compare to them.
//! The labels below are kept as printed so those recorded tables stay readable.
//!
//! **And since #1438 PR2, the "same timing lock" premise below holds only for the soft column and
//! the union's first two variants.** Both now lock on the widened `[−n/2, n)` search; the union
//! additionally tries the restricted `[0, n)` lock (`find_timing_offset_with_expected`) when the two
//! differ, and at this file's frame-at-sample-0 fixture they do differ. So the union column is now
//! two arms at two locks, and its lead over the soft column may include lock rescues as well as the
//! cancelled arm.
//!
//! **What is new here, stated checkably.** #1363 opened with engine-level frame counts, so this is
//! not the thread's first decode rate. It is the first since that opening, and the first whose
//! apparatus is known to put BOTH arms through the same hard RS — the opening left that open, and
//! every number in between is the bad-byte proxy (bad bytes over the 200 payload bytes of a
//! 255-byte wire frame, RS never run), which is a lower bound for both arms alike and explicitly
//! not a decode rate.
//!
//! **Why this was a pure cancellation toggle (before #1428 and #1438 PR2).** Both arms locked timing with the same
//! `find_timing_offset_with_expected` and run the same `demodulate_iq`; the hard arm adds
//! `cancel_crossfade_isi`; the soft arm multiplies by `differential_llr_scale`, a single POSITIVE
//! scalar floored at 1e-6, so hard-decision sign-slicing reproduces `differential_decode`'s
//! `dot < 0` bit for bit. Both then run strict `rs_decode_free_strengthened` + `stage_decode_frame`.
//! `receive_with_llr_combining(n = 1)` is degenerate but not different: one capture, one
//! `demodulate_soft`, and a "combined" fallback that is `combine_llrs_map` of a single vector.
//!
//! **"Hard" is the shipped FIRST-ATTEMPT arm, not the only shipped arm.** It is what CLI
//! `receive_with_fec` and the OTA candidate pass run. The daemon's OTA path also admits `Rs` to the
//! HARQ branch, where `ota_demodulate_soft` produces UNCANCELLED LLRs that are retained and
//! MAP-combined with the next burst — so on air a retransmission is neither arm alone.
//!
//! **Three traps, each handled rather than hoped about** — all three would silently break the A/B:
//!
//! 1. *`decode_prefix` vs strict `decode`.* The soft arm RS-decodes strictly; the SCANNING hard arm
//!    uses `decode_prefix`. With any trailing audio the soft arm fails `FecCodec::decode`'s
//!    multiple-of-255 gate while hard passes — not a toggle. Hence single-shot
//!    `receive_with_fec_mode` on a buffer-IS-the-frame fixture. The table is its own evidence that
//!    this worked: soft reaching 96/96 at 0 dB is only possible if the demodulated byte count
//!    clears strict decode.
//! 2. *AFC carry-over.* Both paths build `mod_cfg` BEFORE `update_afc_estimate` and update AFTER, so
//!    a second arm on the same engine would demodulate at a different `center_frequency`. A fresh
//!    engine per arm per seed removes that BY CONSTRUCTION; the `afc_correction_hz() == 0` assert
//!    pins the constructor's initial state and is not itself the guarantee.
//! 3. *Payload length.* `free_rs_strengthening` upgrades `Rs` to t = 32 at payload <= 177 B, which
//!    would move the cliff every #1363 number is counted against. Hence 200 B.
//!
//! **Why PAIRED, and what that does and does not license.** #1428 pre-registered a MARGINAL
//! threshold — "soft - hard < ~8 frames at 8 dB" — and named no statistic and no SE. The design was
//! paired by seed from the opening onward, so the marginal difference is the SE of an analysis
//! nobody was going to run. Paired at the observed discordance the difference has
//! SE = sqrt(b + c - (b - c)^2 / n) = sqrt(17 - 121/96) = 3.97, so the threshold is ~2 sigma and the
//! observed +11 clears it by 3 frames, i.e. **less than one paired SE**. The discordant pair is the
//! statistic (14 against 3, exact McNemar p = 0.013). Note the order of events honestly: the switch
//! to the paired statistic was made AFTER seeing the data. The per-seed pattern string is printed
//! so a marginal can be audited rather than trusted.
//!
//! **This file asserts nothing about the counts.** It is an instrument, not a gate — the only
//! assertion is on the engine's initial AFC state.
//!
