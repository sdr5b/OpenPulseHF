//! The spectral busy test gathers a frame the total-power carrier detect cannot see (#1454, REQ-DCD-01).
//!
//! A BPSK31 frame at +8 dB in its own 62 Hz band lifts a wide filter's total power by under 2 dB, so
//! the total-power squelch never opens on it (stage 1 pinned 0/4 even at +12 dB). The spectral test
//! judges each 62.5 Hz band against its own floor. These gates drive the production entry
//! (`accumulate_capture`, 400-sample reads) over the recorded IC-9700 idles.
//!
//! Two things decide whether a weak slow frame is gathered whole, and both are pinned here:
//!
//! - **Where the frame's symbols fall on the 512-sample analysis grid.** A BPSK31 reversal nulls its
//!   envelope at the symbol centre; with a centre under the Hann peak a window reads 0.38 of the band
//!   power, and the alternating preamble does that in every window at one parity. The placements below
//!   therefore cover both halves of the grid, and the forced cells pin both preamble parities against
//!   the best case (#1454 rounds 6–7).
//! - **The M2 ring.** A total-power flicker at the frame's onset must not take the frame's head.
//!
//! The counting cells run by default; decode counts are in the held-out suite
//! (`scripts/slow-tests.sh spectral`), because 16 BPSK31 decodes per cell cost minutes unoptimised.
