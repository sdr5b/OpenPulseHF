//! The OTA rate controller's decisions must be observable, including the ones that change nothing.
//!
//! **The gap this pins (#1081).** OTA level *state* was already observable: the daemon emits a
//! `ControlEvent::OtaStatus` snapshot periodically (~1 Hz while a session is active) and after
//! `apply_ota_ack`. What no event carried was the *decision*:
//!
//! - a **failed decode** that leaves the level where it was is invisible in a state snapshot, by
//!   construction — the snapshot reports state and the state did not move. The controller's whole
//!   failure path was dark.
//! - **which branch fired** — fast-downshift, NACK hysteresis, climb-on-SNR, climb-on-evidence —
//!   was recorded nowhere. That is the field that separates "the controller is working" from "the
//!   SNR estimate is broken and the controller is compensating", which is the #934 failure mode.
//! - the **SNR the decision acted on** was passed to `on_rx_frame` and then discarded.
//!
//! `EngineEvent::OtaRateDecision` carries all three. The daemon already forwards every
//! `EngineEvent` into `ControlEvent::EngineEvent`, so one engine-level event reaches the CLI
//! `monitor` NDJSON, the TUI, the panel, and the on-disk audit `events.ndjson` that 1.0 exit
//! criterion A2 is scored from.
