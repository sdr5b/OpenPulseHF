//! The RX burst accumulator's safety cap must not be shorter than the frames the ladder transmits.
//!
//! **The defect this pins** (archetype scan 2026-07-29, finding 1). `BURST_MAX_SAMPLES` was a flat
//! 240 000 samples — 30 s at 8 kHz — chosen as a runaway guard for "the carrier never drops". But
//! `hpx_hf`'s two slowest rungs emit frames *longer than that*: BPSK31 + Rs is ~66 s of audio and
//! BPSK63 + Rs ~33 s. On a real streaming capture the cap therefore fired mid-frame on every normal
//! transmission, force-flushing the burst into two preamble-less halves, neither decodable.
//!
//! SL2 (BPSK31) is `hpx_hf`'s `initial_level` — the rung every session starts on and must confirm
//! before it can climb — so this sat directly on the on-air critical path.
//!
//! **Why the suite could not have caught it.** Every test that reaches `accumulate_capture` uses a
//! fast mode (OFDM52-16QAM, QPSK500, BPSK250), whose frames are far under 30 s. The cap cannot fire
//! for them, so no existing gate could fail in the presence of this bug. The two constants — the cap
//! here and the frame length stated in prose at `profile.rs` — were simply never compared.
