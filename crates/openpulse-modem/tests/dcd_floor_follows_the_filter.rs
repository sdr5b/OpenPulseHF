//! The daemon's carrier detect follows the band behind ANY receive filter (#1452, REQ-DCD-01).
//!
//! Before #1452 the squelch floor was a low percentile ACROSS the 300–2700 Hz bins, scaled as if the
//! noise were white across that band. Behind a 500 Hz or 250 Hz receive filter most of those bins are
//! stopband, so the floor read the stopband and the squelch collapsed to its clamp: every block read
//! as carrier, bursts flushed only at the 37 s runaway cap, and a frame the decoder could read lay
//! past the onset scan's reach (measured through this same entry: production 0/8, the same slab
//! decoded from the frame's offset 5/8; the other three trials fed less audio than the cap, so no
//! burst was ever flushed).
//!
//! Everything here drives the production entry (`accumulate_capture`) on the recorded IC-9700 and
//! FT-991A idle captures. Frame levels are set by the noise INSIDE the frame's band, computed here
//! from the capture itself — behind a narrow filter nearly all the noise is in-band, so a total-power
//! ratio would put the narrow-filter frames several dB below the wide-filter ones.
//!
//! The receiver notch is OFF here (the engine default; the daemon's config default is on), so the
//! floor measured is the band's, birdies included.
