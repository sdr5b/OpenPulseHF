//! MEASUREMENT HARNESS for #1118 — the comparison is assert-free; it prints a table.
//!
//! Replays the REAL on-air corpus in `tests/captures/` through BOTH receive paths. Every other
//! corpus test drives only `receive_with_timeout*` — the CLI path — so before this the corpus had
//! never been through `accumulate_capture`, and nobody knew whether the #1118 seam costs anything on
//! audio a radio actually produced.
//!
//! Measured (2026-08-13): **CLI 5/7, daemon 1/7.** The daemon loses every RS-coded capture the CLI
//! recovers, including the #1021 artifact and three independent-SDR recordings.
//!
//! **DO NOT read that as "the acquisition chain earns its keep".** That was the first conclusion
//! drawn here and adversarial review FALSIFIED it by ablation: with the energy gate, the settle, the
//! #1049 veto and the condemnation recovery all absent, and AFC pinned at 0, both lost bursts decode
//! as soon as the candidate loop is run over SCANNED ONSETS. The distinctive chain components
//! contributed nothing these captures needed (they sit at +2 Hz and ~+12 Hz, well inside BPSK250's
//! tolerance, so the settle was idle even on the CLI arm's wins).
//!
//! The real defect this table exposes is a BLIND SIBLING PATH, not a missing chain:
//! `decode_burst_inner` (the uncoded arm, `server.rs:930`) scans onsets in symbol-period steps across
//! up to 4 acquisition windows. `ota_decode_and_ack_inner` (the coded arm, `server.rs:866`) makes
//! ONE attempt per candidate, at offset 0, on the full burst.
//!
//! The demod's timing search spans about one and a half symbol periods (`[−n/2, n)` since #1438;
//! one period, 32 samples at BPSK250, when this was written), so a frame a few
//! thousand samples into a burst is undecodable without a scan — and that is exactly where these
//! frames sit. The daemon's one success is its uncoded row: the coded/uncoded split tracks SCAN
//! PRESENCE, not chain presence.
//!
//! So this harness does NOT settle the #1118 design question, and in particular it does not refute
//! re-scoping: on this corpus the daemon's own adaptive-squelch DCD located the frames perfectly
//! well (verified — no burst was chopped; the failing bursts each contain the whole frame intact).
//! What WOULD settle it is a capture with a real carrier offset: these are near-on-frequency, while
//! the one cleanly measured inter-rig offset on this project's hardware is **−64 Hz** (IC-9700 <->
//! FT-991A, both commanded to 144.600000 MHz, 2026-07-28 — `openpulse-channel/src/cfo.rs`), which
//! already exceeds **REQ-PHY-03**'s ±50 Hz requirement, and a scan-only daemon would fail it. That is
//! the argument for porting the settle, and this corpus structurally cannot make it.
//!
//! (An earlier version of this sentence said "~400 Hz". That figure traces to the two-station OTA
//! notes, whose CFO readings are marked unreliable **in the same paragraph** — the spectral
//! peak-picker was measuring dev-host birdies rather than the carrier. −64 Hz is the trusted
//! measurement and is all the argument needs.)
//!
//! Known limits, stated so the number is not over-read: n=7 and all from one rig pair on one band;
//! the pre-whitening rows fail on both paths by design; and `decode_burst`'s 4x-acquisition-window
//! scan bound cleared the #1021 lead-in by only 64 samples, so it is not obviously sufficient for a
//! coded-arm fix.
//!
//! Run: cargo test -p openpulse-modem --no-default-features --test daemon_vs_cli_on_real_captures -- --ignored --nocapture
