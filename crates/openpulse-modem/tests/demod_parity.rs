//! #1062 vetting column 4 — demod parity for a candidate preamble sequence.
//!
//! #1062 proposes replacing the BPSK preamble (32 bits alternating; NRZI makes
//! the symbols `--++` repeating, period 4) with an aperiodic sync word. Three
//! vetting columns already exist — noise ceiling, decode edge, grid half-width.
//! This is the fourth: **does a candidate still serve the preamble's other
//! jobs?** It gates every candidate, and it decides whether BPSK31/63 change at
//! all, since those rungs gain nothing on the acquisition path (they publish no
//! template) and are justified only by uniformity or by a parity gain measured
//! here.
//!
//! ## What is instrumented, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! | column | instrument | note |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | A timing | the real `find_timing_offset_with_expected` — since #1438 PR2 the RESCUE lock (`[0, n)`); the primary widened lock is not measured here | error **rate**, not a point error |
//! | B coarse AFC | the shipped `afc_estimate_hz` (stage 1 is expectation-blind) | lock-error rate |
//! | C fine AFC | `afc_estimate_hz_with_expected` | stage 2 locks timing, so it needs the matched expectation |
//! | D self-ambiguity | `IqMatchedFilter::search_normalized` over whole-symbol lags | the property #1062 exists to fix |
//! | E end-to-end | `bpsk_modulate_with_preamble` → channel → `bpsk_demodulate_with_expected` | the deciding column |
//!
//! Two things are **not** measured and must not be inferred from a pass here:
//! the `-RRC` path (its timing is Gardner+LMS, so a candidate reaches it through
//! training, which this seam does not cover), and any **fixed-duration**
//! candidate at the slow rungs — a 110 ms sync word is 3.4 symbols at 31.25 baud,
//! so it cannot be a symbol-rate sequence swap at all and the shipped estimators
//! would be restructured rather than re-parameterised. For those, this harness
//! reports "not representable" rather than a number.
//!
//! Rung floors come from `SessionProfile::hpx_hf` by reference, never
//! transcribed (verification rule 5).
