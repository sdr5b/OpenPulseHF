//! OTA receive — including HARQ combining — driven through the daemon's **production** capture
//! entry, not the convenience seam.
//!
//! Captured audio reaches the OTA decoder two different ways. Every existing OTA test hands a
//! perfectly-trimmed `AudioSamples` straight to `ota_decode_burst`. The running daemon never does
//! that: `server::run`'s `rx_ticker` feeds *tick-sized chunks* to `accumulate_capture`, which routes
//! them through the `InputCapture` seam, gathers them under DCD gating, and flushes a burst only when
//! the carrier drops — so a real burst's boundaries are decided by the DCD, and it carries whatever
//! leading/trailing channel audio the squelch let through.
//!
//! That gap is not hypothetical: it is exactly what let the audit's finding #3 (the OTA decode loop
//! re-running the InputCapture front-end) ship unnoticed, and CLAUDE.md's cross-cutting RX checklist
//! calls for a test through the production entry for precisely this reason. These tests close it for
//! the OTA path, and in doing so put the HARQ retention/combining work (#920/#921/#922) on the same
//! footing — that machinery only ever pays off on the daemon's async bursts.
