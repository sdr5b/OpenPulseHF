//! The daemon's streaming receive path RUNS the acquisition chain (#1118).
//!
//! **This file previously asserted the opposite**, and was named `daemon_skips_acquisition_chain`.
//! It pinned the gap: `EnergyGate` → refined onset → `afc_mini_settle` → the #1049
//! preamble-correlation veto lived inside `receive_with_timeout_fec`, which only the CLI listen path
//! reaches, while the shipping daemon's `rx_ticker` called `accumulate_capture` and then one of two
//! decode arms and reached none of it. Its header said: *"When it is resolved these tests SHOULD
//! fail — that is the point. Change them deliberately."* #1118 resolved it, they failed, and this is
//! that deliberate change: the same two arms, the same counters, the assertion inverted.
//!
//! **What is pinned now.** Both daemon decode arms reach the acquisition chain on a burst phase 1
//! cannot decode, and both reach the **veto**, not merely the settle. The two-counter structure is
//! kept for the reason the original gave: `afc_settle_attempts()` increments at the chain's ENTRY on
//! every mode, while the `rho_*` pair records what the veto DECIDED and moves only where a preamble
//! template exists. A gate on the entry counter alone would stay green if phase 2 were half-wired —
//! settle without veto — which is exactly what shipped in the first #1118 implementation: the veto
//! ran and fed the #1157 calibration but reported nothing, so its decisions were unobservable.
//!
//! **The complement lives in `daemon_frequency_acquisition.rs`** and must not be merged into this
//! file: there, an on-frequency burst that phase 1 decodes must spend **zero** settles. Together the
//! two files pin the whole two-phase design — phase 2 runs when phase 1 failed, and never otherwise.
//!
//! **Both daemon decode arms are covered, because `server::run` has two.** It dispatches on
//! `engine.ota_active()` (`server.rs:858`): with an OTA session it calls `ota_decode_burst`, and
//! otherwise — the DEFAULT, since `ota_enabled` is opt-in — it calls `decode_burst`
//! (`server.rs:930`). An early version of this file exercised NEITHER: it called `ota_decode_burst`
//! with no session started, so the call returned `Err("no OTA session active")` before reaching any
//! decode work, and `let _ =` swallowed it. Both arms still assert the shape of what they got back,
//! so a silent no-op cannot recur.
//!
//! **Vacuity is still the design problem**, in mirror image. "Counters moved" must not be reachable
//! by feeding audio that drives the chain nowhere, and "phase 2 ran" must not depend on phase 1
//! happening to fail for an incidental reason. So the frame is transmitted and then shifted by
//! `OFFSET_HZ` with the shipped `CfoChannel`: at that offset phase 1 **cannot** decode (measured in
//! `daemon_frequency_acquisition.rs`: the coded arm fails from 50 Hz), so phase 2 must run by
//! construction. Each arm additionally asserts a burst actually flushed, that
//! `dcd_blocks_processed() > 0` so the shared `InputCapture` seam ran, and that the decode call
//! returned a real outcome rather than erroring out early.
