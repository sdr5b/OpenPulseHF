//! HARQ soft-combining across OTA retransmissions, driven through the daemon's decode entry
//! (`ota_decode_burst`).
//!
//! `receive_with_llr_combining` (the #694 union) is synchronous multi-capture and RS-only, so it
//! never fit the daemon's async, per-MODCOD OTA flow — the diversity gain it measured never reached
//! the air. This wires it in: `ota_decode_and_ack` now retains the soft LLRs of a *failed* burst,
//! keyed by `(session, mode)`, and MAP-combines them with the next burst of the same mode before
//! giving up. On `moderate_f1` near a rung's threshold each burst is a partially-ruined observation of
//! the same bits; summing their calibrated LLRs across independent fade realisations decodes frames no
//! single burst can. Exercised here on SL9 (`OFDM52-16QAM` + SoftConcatenated on the fade-aware ladder).
//!
//! The gate: over many fade realisations, a single engine that retains and combines across three
//! sequential bursts must decode more frames than three *independent* engines each decoding one burst
//! standalone. That gap is the diversity the retention adds; a regression that drops the retained LLRs
//! (or clears them too eagerly) collapses it back to the standalone baseline.
