//! A multi-attempt scan must not narrate its discarded hypotheses to the event stream.
//!
//! Every scanning loop — `decode_burst_inner`, the OTA candidate/HARQ loops, and
//! `receive_with_timeout_fec`'s retry loop — restores `afc_correction_hz` after a failed attempt.
//! An `AfcUpdate` emitted from inside one of those attempts therefore reports a correction the
//! engine immediately throws away. It is not state, and at scan volume it is destructive: a BPSK250
//! noise scan makes ~129 attempts against a 64-slot broadcast ring, so the ring overflows and
//! EVICTS genuine events. That is how a failed OTA burst lost its own `OtaRateDecision` — the event
//! #1081 exists to guarantee.
//!
//! The rule under test is **commit-gating, not failure-gating**: a single-window receive keeps its
//! estimate even when the decode fails, so those emissions are real state and must keep flowing
//! (that is what the TUI's AFC meter renders during acquisition). Only rolled-back attempts are
//! silent.
//!
//! The assertion is the semantic property itself — ZERO events from a fully-rolled-back scan — not
//! a tuned events-per-burst bound that would drift with the scan geometry.
