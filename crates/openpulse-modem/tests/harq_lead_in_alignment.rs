//! MEASUREMENT for #1139 — does HARQ's offset-0 soft demod actually cost diversity?
//!
//! The HARQ block demodulates the whole burst at offset 0 (`ota_demodulate_soft(mode,
//! &samples.samples)`), with no onset scan — the third site missing one after #1138 fixed the coded
//! decode arm. The combine's own comment states the assumption it relies on: retained vectors
//! "share a start and a grid, so index k means the same bit in both".
//!
//! Bursts with DIFFERENT lead-ins break that. The daemon's burst start is set by tick size, DCD hold
//! and key-up dead carrier, none of which repeat exactly, so real retransmissions of one frame
//! arrive with differing lead-in — and each vector is then offset relative to the others by the
//! difference. Summing them is not a MAP combine of the same bits.
//!
//! This measures rather than assumes, because #1138 just demonstrated that the obvious attribution
//! can be wrong: there, a corpus gap that looked like missing acquisition machinery was entirely an
//! onset scan, and two-thirds of the apparent cost was dead work no design option would have touched.
//!
//! Assert-free on the comparison; it prints a table. It DOES assert its own integrity — an
//! aligned-case combine that shows no gain would mean the harness never exercised HARQ at all, and
//! the misaligned column would say nothing.
//!
//! Run: cargo test -p openpulse-modem --no-default-features --test harq_lead_in_alignment -- --ignored --nocapture
