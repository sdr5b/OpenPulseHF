//! The carrier detector must measure the PRE-AGC level, so an enabled AGC's boost can't wedge the squelch.
//!
//! Bug: DCD used to run on the samples returned by the InputCapture seam — i.e. POST-AGC. After a weak
//! burst ramps the AGC gain up (and the active-span gate freezes it there through silence), the held gain
//! multiplies sub-squelch band noise back over the DCD busy threshold, so the channel reads "busy" forever
//! and CSMA never lets the station transmit. DCD now runs inside the seam, before the AGC, on the true
//! channel level. This pins that the boosted-noise floor no longer registers as a carrier.
