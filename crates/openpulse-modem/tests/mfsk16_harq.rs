//! HARQ soft-combining on the MFSK16 sub-floor rung (SL1), driven through the daemon's decode entry.
//!
//! MFSK16 was held out of HARQ combining because every frame is one fixed 255-byte RS block, so
//! nothing could tell an abandoned message's retained LLRs from a retransmission of the live one —
//! worst case, combining could deliver the wrong message. The newest-first suffix trial in
//! `ota_decode_and_ack_inner` contains that hazard by construction (a stale message's bursts are
//! always older, so some suffix excludes them), which is what admits `Rs` to the soft path here.
//!
//! It earns its place on the number: MFSK16 is soft-capable, and `decode_combined_llrs` handles `Rs`
//! by hard-deciding the *combined* vector, so summing calibrated LLRs across independent fades pulls
//! the hard-decision error count under RS(255,223)'s 16-byte-per-block capacity. Measured on
//! `moderate_f1` over 60 realisations per arm, three bursts — roughly **+2.5 dB** of sub-floor
//! sensitivity:
//!
//! ```text
//! SNR    standalone  combining
//! -6.0      0.000      0.267     <- decodes where no single burst ever does
//! -5.0      0.067      0.583
//! -4.0      0.117      0.750
//! -3.0      0.417      0.933
//! -2.0      0.683      0.983
//! ```
//!
//! This is the rung the ChirpFallback path drops to under sustained failure, so the gain lands
//! exactly where the link has nothing else left.
