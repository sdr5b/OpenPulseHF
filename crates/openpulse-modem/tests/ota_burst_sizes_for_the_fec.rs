//! THE #1384 GATE: the OTA coded arm scans with slices sized for the CODED frame.
//!
//! Both OTA onset scans took `max_frame_samples` from `burst_onset_scan_bounds`, which returns the
//! plugin's **raw** geometry — sized for one RS block plus envelope. Offset 0 is exempt (the attempt
//! before the scan decodes the whole burst), so the defect only bites at a **non-zero** onset, which
//! is why it sat unseen behind a green suite.
//!
//! **MEASURED before it was fixed, because the issue was filed as a code read.** On BPSK250 the raw
//! geometry is **74 624** samples; a coded frame past the one-block boundary is **131 840**. Decode
//! of a frame at a non-zero onset, by payload size:
//!
//! | payload | RS input (4 + payload + 10) | blocks | frame samples | decoded before the fix |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | 200 B | 214 | 1 | 66 560 | yes |
//! | 205 B | 219 | 1 | 66 560 | yes |
//! | 210 B | 224 | **2** | **131 840** | **no** |
//! | 255 B | 269 | 2 | 131 840 | **no** |
//!
//! **The boundary is payload ≤ 209 B, not 213 B**, and getting that wrong is worth recording:
//! `FecCodec::encode` prepends a 4-byte big-endian length prefix (`PREFIX_LEN`) BEFORE blocking, so
//! the RS input is `4 + payload + WIRE_OVERHEAD(10)` and one block holds 223 of it. An earlier
//! statement of this boundary in #1310 PR1b omitted the prefix and said 213 B. The gates built on it
//! are unaffected — 200 B and 255 B sit on the correct sides of 209 either way — but the arithmetic
//! was wrong in the records and is corrected here and there.
