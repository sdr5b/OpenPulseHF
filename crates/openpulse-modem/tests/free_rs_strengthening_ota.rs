//! Small frames get free `RsStrong` on the weak rungs, and the OTA receiver decodes them — #934 follow-up.
//!
//! The weak `hpx_hf` rungs are RS-coded (t=16). `RsStrong` (t=32) roughly doubles their fading decode
//! and is *free on the wire* for small frames — same 255-byte RS block. But the profile FEC is a
//! per-level constant with no per-frame signalling, so the sender strengthens opportunistically
//! (`free_rs_strengthening`) and the receiver must try both codes. This proves the receive half: an
//! `RsStrong`-sent frame decodes through the OTA path whose rung is `Rs`. Without the candidate
//! expansion in `ota_decode_and_ack_inner`, the receiver only tries `Rs` and this fails.
