//! The ISS ACK listen must find the ACK *inside* a noisy capture, not only when the ACK is the whole
//! buffer (#1177).
//!
//! Every pre-existing ACK test hands `receive_ota_ack_within` a buffer that IS the ACK, so the
//! whole-buffer `decode_fsk4_ack` succeeds before the in-stream scan ever runs — the same
//! buffer-is-the-frame shape `route_embedded` exists to close on the data path. Under band noise the
//! production path is `decode_fsk4_ack_in_stream`, and it was refusing ~60 % of real ACKs at the ACK
//! channel's own operating point because its window gate thresholded on the whole buffer's PEAK.
//!
//! SNR here is the harness's full-band convention (`AwgnConfig`): FSK4-ACK occupies ~300 Hz of the
//! 4 kHz band, so 4 dB full-band is well above the waveform's in-band floor. It is the same
//! convention `plugins/fsk4/tests/fsk4_integration.rs` uses to call +4 dB the operating point.
