//! Every `hpx_hf` rung must decode on a fading HF channel — the property the ladder exists for.
//!
//! `hpx_hf` is *the* HF profile, so fading is its design case, not an edge case. It used not to hold:
//! calibrated on AWGN, the ladder shipped four rungs that decoded ~0 % of Watterson `moderate_f1`
//! frames at any SNR (QPSK250/QPSK500 uncoded, 8PSK500+Rs, SCFDMA26-32QAM), and the uncoded BPSK
//! rungs — including SL2, the `initial_level` every session starts on — decoded ~0 % at their own
//! SNR floors. Nothing caught it because every gate measured AWGN. This one measures the fade.
//!
//! Deliberately a *weak* bar (≥ 0.25 at floor+4 dB, well under the measured values): it is a
//! dead-rung tripwire, not a floor calibration. `snr_floor_calibration.rs` is where the numbers get
//! tuned; this is what fails if a rung stops working on a fade at all.
