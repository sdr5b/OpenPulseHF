//! The `hpx_hf` high-rate-LDPC top rungs (SL15–SL17) must decode at the AWGN SNR they were calibrated
//! at, and must deliver the throughput that justifies their higher floors.
//!
//! `LdpcHighRate` (r ≈ 8/9) costs +4…+8 dB of floor over `SoftConcatenated` (r ≈ 0.437) and returns
//! 2.03× the rate. That is a *worse* trade than climbing one modulation order — so LDPC earns a rung
//! only above SL15, where 64QAM is already the densest constellation the plugin has and code rate is
//! the last lever left.
