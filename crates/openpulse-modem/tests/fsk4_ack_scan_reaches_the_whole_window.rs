//! The FSK4-ACK scan must reach the whole listen window, and must not starve on a foreign ACK (#1247).
//!
//! `decode_fsk4_ack_in_stream` bounded its trial-decode onset scan at 16 000 samples — 2 s at 8 kHz —
//! inside a window the same function sizes at 4 s, or 9 s when the profile carries the MFSK16
//! sub-floor rung, which `hpx_hf` does. Nothing rescued an ACK past that bound: the whole-buffer
//! decode cannot carry a noisy lead (that is why the scan exists), a normal-rung ACK is transmitted
//! as FSK4 rather than K=3, and a retry opens a fresh buffer instead of accumulating.
//!
//! **Both tests deliver the capture in chunks**, via `LoopbackBackend::push_frame` (one queued frame
//! per read). That is load-bearing: the unpaced loopback returns a whole `fill_samples` capture in
//! ONE read, so the growth-throttled rescan never runs more than once and neither defect below can
//! occur. Every pre-existing ACK test feeds it that way, which is why both survived a green suite.
