//! The RX burst cap must cover the RELAY consumer's rung, not just this station's (#1308).
//!
//! Under #1308's decision the cross-band repeater stops capturing its own audio and reads the bursts
//! the daemon's accumulator flushes. So the cap — which bounds runaway growth, sized from a mode —
//! must cover whatever the repeater is configured to receive, exactly as #1249 made it cover the OTA
//! candidate rungs rather than the configured mode alone.
//!
//! Without that, a station on `mode = "BPSK250"` (cap 37.3 s) relaying `[repeater] mode = "BPSK31"`
//! (66.6 s at one RS block, 131.8 s at two) has **every frame it exists to forward** force-flushed
//! mid-frame. The two modes being DIFFERENT is the whole configuration in which the defect exists;
//! `burst_cap_frame_length.rs` queries the cap with the slow rung itself and cannot see it.
