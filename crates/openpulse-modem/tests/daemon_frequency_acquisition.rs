//! #1118 — the daemon's streaming receive path must acquire a real carrier offset.
//!
//! `REQ-PHY-03` requires the demodulator to track station-to-station offsets of up to ±50 Hz without
//! operator intervention. Before this, the shipping daemon failed at exactly 50 Hz: its burst path
//! scanned onsets but never estimated frequency, so it decoded 0 Hz and 20 Hz and nothing beyond.
//! The CLI path (`receive_with_timeout_fec`) has always acquired, which is why the gap survived —
//! every corpus capture sits at +2 to ~+12 Hz, inside BPSK250's tolerance, so no existing test could
//! see it. The measurement that exposed it is
//! `daemon_vs_cli_on_real_captures::m2_carrier_offset_sweep_cli_vs_daemon`.
//!
//! **Which arm was broken, measured rather than assumed.** The uncoded arm (`decode_burst`) already
//! tolerated 50 Hz natively; the coded arm (`ota_decode_burst`) failed from 50 Hz, which is the
//! requirement bound, so that is where the defect lived. Measured on this file's own fixture,
//! uncoded frame through the uncoded arm: 0 Hz and 50 Hz decode with **0** settles; 200 Hz and
//! 400 Hz decode with 126.
//!
//! **Corrected 2026-09-23 (#1428): this used to add "it needs the acquisition pass only past
//! ~200 Hz", an interpolation across those four points that is false.** Measured in review (Fable,
//! 2026-09-22/23) across all 64 sub-symbol alignments of this fixture: the uncancelled arm (which the
//! uncoded arm runs) decodes 40/64 at 50 Hz, 0/64 at 62.5, 75, 100 and 200 Hz, and 52/64 at 250 Hz;
//! the cancelled arm decodes 0/64 below 250 Hz and 49/64 there. #1428's own daemon sweep of this
//! fixture (six realisations) needed the acquisition pass on all six at 75–200 Hz and on three at
//! 300 Hz. A review MODEL — not a measurement — has the crossfade term rotating against the symbol's
//! own energy by ~0.4°/Hz, which would make native tolerance non-monotonic in offset. It is also
//! frame-dependent: the same review measured the preamble timing correlation at ~5 % of its peak at
//! 50 Hz, and a different 200 B frame mis-locked and failed both arms at 25 Hz. **Do not read
//! "decodes natively at X Hz" from this fixture as a property of the receiver** — the acquisition
//! pass is what REQ-PHY-03 rests on. Both arms get the
//! pass, because both are reachable on a shipping station and the uncoded one is what carries
//! station ID, filexfer, handshake, QSY and relay traffic.
//!
//! These are the gates, driven through the **production entry** (`accumulate_capture` in tick-sized
//! chunks, then `ota_decode_burst`) on audio built from a real engine-transmitted frame, shifted by
//! the shipped `CfoChannel`, embedded in **real recorded idle** so the receiver must locate the frame
//! as well as acquire it.
