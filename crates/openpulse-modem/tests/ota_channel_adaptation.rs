//! Real-stack OTA adaptive rate-stepping through a SIMULATED CHANNEL.
//!
//! `ota_rate_lockstep.rs` proves the receiver-led lockstep over a CLEAN wire with
//! an injected SNR. This harness goes one layer closer to reality: two
//! `ModemEngine`s run the **real** `OtaRateController` / `RateAdapter`, bridged
//! forward (data) and reverse (ACK) through `openpulse_channel` models, and the
//! IRS derives its rate decision from the **real M2M4 SNR estimate** on the
//! faded/noisy capture (no injected SNR). This is the headless deterministic
//! validation of the explicitly-deferred hard problem — RX-side lockstep
//! adaptation under loss/fading — that `openpulse-linksim` only models.
//!
//! It exercises paths a clean-loopback test cannot:
//! - the M2M4 estimator reading a real channel SNR and driving the ladder;
//! - channel-induced ACK loss (a faded FSK4 ACK that fails CRC), not artificial;
//! - the candidate fallback + absolute recommendation recovering after a fade.
