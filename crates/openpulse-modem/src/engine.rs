        //
        // `DcdState` shipped with a fixed 0.01 RMS threshold, and a real band floor walks straight
        // over a constant: the recorded IC-9700 idle capture measures 0.126 RMS, twelve times it. On
        // that band the daemon's carrier detect reads permanently busy, the burst never ends on a
        // carrier drop, and only the runaway cap flushes it — so the decoder is handed a bufferful
        // of noise and a real frame never arrives at all. This is the *daemon's* half of the same
        // hot-floor failure the scanning receive path hit five times; none of that path's machinery
        // (`EnergyGate`, the settle, the #1049 veto) runs here.
        //
        // The floor comes from the passband spectral distribution, not from block energies, because
        // a carrier that stays on raises every block and drags a time-domain percentile up with it —
        // exactly how `EnergyGate` saturates. Re-measured on the real capture after #1254, at the
        // daemon's own read size and with the frame SUPERIMPOSED on the noise (the fixture used to
        // append it, which put digital silence in the noise bins under the frame and collapsed the
        // floor instead of testing it): the spectral floor reads **0.1289 RMS on idle and 0.1343
        // with a frame present** (+4 %), while the total level goes **0.126 → 0.2255** (+79 %).
        // That immovability is the whole point. The older figures here (0.138/0.140) were the EMA's
        // output when it stepped once per multi-window read; it now steps per window.
        //
        // The premise is bounded, and #1304 is where it fails: a signal filling most of the
        // analysed 300–2700 Hz band is not a narrowband carrier, and the estimator recovers ITS
        // mean square. OFDM52/SCFDMA52 at 2031 Hz are exactly that.
        //
        // Deliberately mode-independent. A noise floor is a property of the band, not the waveform,
        // and this sits at the single shared `InputCapture` seam so every receive path gets it.
        //
        // #1452 replaced the estimator: the floor is now each bin's noise level over time, summed —
        // the noise power the block RMS sees — so a narrow receive filter no longer collapses it to
        // the clamp, and the tracker is HELD while a burst is gathered (`accumulate_routed`), so a
        // long frame cannot raise it (#1304). The operator's value is a lower bound on it.
        //
        // A block is judged against the floor from BEFORE it, and a block that clears the squelch is
        // not learned as band. Learning first let a read that holds a whole frame — the read after a
        // blocking decode or transmit can hold seconds of audio, and the twin rig delivers a frame in
        // one read — teach the floor the frame, which then never cleared the squelch it had raised.
        // Two exceptions: a cold tracker learns everything (it has nothing to judge with), and a held
        // tracker keeps the audio aside for the burst's end to decide (`accumulate_routed`).
        //
        // On the accumulator path a carrier block STARTS the hold rather than being dropped, so the
        // burst's end can still learn from it: a burst too short to hold any preamble is the band
        // flickering over the squelch, and leaving its blocks out biased the floor low (measured on the
        // 250 Hz capture at 171-sample reads: squelch/idle 1.142 with the burst discarded, sabotage

            // starving the loop so the frame never finishes buffering — and the
            // first-energy micro-sweep below already owns the decode there.  Other
            // modes (notably wideband SCFDMA/OFDM, whose marginal settle the
            // single-carrier micro-sweep can't decode) keep the retry; their short
            // frames re-scan cheaply, so it never starves them.
            // THIRD wall-clock dependency, and the one #1066 missed. `retry_due` schedules the
            // full-buffer retry on elapsed SECONDS, so a slower profile fires fewer retries per
            // unit of work. That is correct in production for the reason `RETRY_START_SECS`
            // documents — effective sample rates vary 2300-7600/s between audio stacks, so a
            // sample count is not a reliable clock there. It is fatal to measurement, and it

#[cfg(test)]
mod burst_decode_sizes_for_the_fec {
    //! THE #1310 PR1b GATE: a CODED burst is scanned with slices sized for the CODED frame.
    //!
    //! `decode_burst` took its per-attempt slice from `frame_scan_geometry`, which returns the
    //! plugin's **raw** `max_frame_samples` — sized for ONE RS block plus envelope — and hardcoded
    //! `FecMode::None` at the decode. So it was an uncoded-only entry point, which is why the ARDOP
    //! and KISS front ends have no coded burst path.
    //!
    //! **The boundary is exact, and it is what these payload sizes are chosen against.** The wire
    //! form is `payload + Frame::WIRE_OVERHEAD` (10 B), and RS(255,223) is a single block iff the
    //! wire form is ≤ 223 — i.e. **payload ≤ 213 B**. At 213 B or below the coded frame still fits a
    //! raw-sized slice, so a gate written there passes with the widening deleted and proves nothing.
    //! At 214 B and above the coded frame is TWO blocks and a raw slice truncates it.
    //!
    //! Hence the discriminating pair: a **255 B** payload (two blocks, must decode) against a
    //! **200 B control** (one block, must also decode). The control is load-bearing — it passes with
    //! the widening deleted, which is what proves a failure of the 255 B case is about SIZING rather
    //! than about coded bursts in general.
    //!
    //! Both sit at a **non-zero onset**: offset 0 is exempt by construction, because the scan's first
    //! slice starts at sample 0 and holds the whole frame.
    //!
    //! **This lives in-crate on purpose.** `decode_burst_with_fec` is `pub(crate)` until its
    //! cross-crate caller lands (PR1c), and this repo's rule is that a probe needing non-public
    //! access is a unit test rather than an exported accessor.
