//! Known-answer vectors for the v2 binary handshake (#1147).
//!
//! **What a KAT buys that a round-trip test does not.** A round-trip proves the encoder and decoder
//! agree with *each other* — it passes just as happily if both drift together, which is exactly what
//! a format change does. These vectors pin the encoder's output against a value recorded outside the
//! code, so a layout change, a field reorder, or a different signing span fails here even when every
//! round-trip still passes.
//!
//! **Scope: pre-SAR and pre-whitening.** The vectors are the frame as `create` returns it, before
//! fragmentation and before the wire scrambler. That is deliberate — #1148 changed the whitening
//! keystream, and a KAT taken further down the stack would have been invalidated by a change that has
//! nothing to do with this format.
//!
//! **Why the signature pins too.** Ed25519 signing is deterministic (RFC 8032): no per-signature
//! randomness, so the same key over the same message yields the same 64 bytes on every run and every
//! platform. `ed25519-dalek`'s `rand_core` feature gates KEY GENERATION only, and these vectors use a
//! fixed seed rather than generating one.
