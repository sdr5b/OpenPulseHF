//! The ladder must climb on evidence, not only on an SNR estimate — issue #934.
//!
//! The controller used to have exactly one upward path: `snr_db >= ceiling(rx_confirmed)`. That
//! makes the SNR estimate the *sole permission* to climb, which fails whenever the estimate is
//! uninformative — and on a fading channel it can be uninformative **in principle**: at 31 baud a
//! 1 Hz Doppler fade decorrelates in ~6 symbols, so no window is both short enough to track the
//! fade and long enough to average the noise, and the estimate reads a constant. `hpx_hf` on
//! Watterson `moderate_f1` therefore sat pinned on its entry rung at ~5 bps **while delivering
//! 20/20 frames** — the rungs it could have reached carry ~300–1200.
//!
//! These tests pin the contract: a rung that keeps decoding earns the next step even with a useless
//! SNR reading; a frame that decoded is never answered with a demotion (the observation beats the
//! model); and SNR keeps its fast-downshift on actual failures, where it explains something.
