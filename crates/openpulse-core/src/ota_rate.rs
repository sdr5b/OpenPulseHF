//! Receiver-led, per-direction adaptive rate control with RX lockstep.
//!
//! On a two-way link each *data receiver* leads the rate for the direction it
//! receives: it measures channel quality, picks an **absolute** target speed
//! level, and ships that level to the sender in the ACK
//! ([`crate::ack::AckFrame::recommended_level`]). The sender simply follows.
//!
//! ## Lockstep invariant
//!
//! The receiver advances its recommendation at most **one mapped step** above the
//! highest level it has actually decoded (`rx_confirmed`). So the demodulation
//! candidate set `{rx_recommended, rx_confirmed}` is always exactly the 1–2 modes
//! the sender could be transmitting:
//!
//! - sender adopted the recommendation → it sends at `rx_recommended`;
//! - the recommending ACK was lost → the sender still uses the last level it was
//!   told, which is `rx_confirmed`.
//!
//! Because the node that *decides* the mode is the node that *demodulates* it, a
//! lost ACK can never desync the two ends — it only delays the climb by one frame.
//!
//! ## Two ways up: SNR, and evidence
//!
//! The climb has two independent triggers, and the invariant above holds for both because each
//! advances **exactly one mapped step** above `rx_confirmed`:
//!
//! - **SNR** — the measured SNR clears the confirmed rung's ceiling. Fast, but only as trustworthy
//!   as the estimate.
//! - **Success** — [`ACK_CLIMB_THRESHOLD`] consecutive clean decodes at the confirmed rung. Slower,
//!   but it cannot lie: frames decoding *is* the evidence that the rung works.
//!
//! The second exists because the first is not always available. An SNR estimator on a fading channel
//! can be uninformative *in principle* — at 31 baud a 1 Hz Doppler fade decorrelates in ~6 symbols,
//! so no window is both short enough to track the fade and long enough to average the noise, and the
//! estimate reads a constant. With SNR as the only permission to climb, such a link sat pinned on its
//! entry rung **while every single frame decoded** (issue #934): `hpx_hf` on Watterson `moderate_f1`
//! delivered 20/20 frames at ~5 bps, where the rungs it could have reached carry ~300–1200.
//! Ignoring a perfect decode record because a number did not move is the bug; SNR is an accelerator,
//! not the sole permission.
//!
//! The SNR *downshift* is deliberately left as the sole fast-down path and is checked first — a rung
//! that decodes is not evidence that a *higher* rung will, so success may only ever propose the next
//! step, and only when SNR does not already say we are too high.
//!
//! This is pure logic: no I/O, no engine coupling, fully unit-tested. The modem
//! engine drives it by reporting which candidate decoded and the measured SNR.
