//! THE #1325 GATE: the repeater must not key rig_b while rig_b's band is busy.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** A cross-band relay is an unattended §97.221 station that transmits on a band
//! it never listens to. Before this it keyed rig_b whenever a burst decoded on the *input* side, so
//! it would double with whatever QSO was already on the output — repeatedly, for as long as traffic
//! kept arriving. `openpulse-mesh`'s auto-transmit capability was REMOVED rather than guarded, and
//! "no carrier sense" was one of the four stated reasons; the repeater had the other three.
//!
//! **The obvious fix was measured and rejected.** `ModemEngine::enable_csma()` exists, but
//! `update_dcd_at_seam` has one caller — the RX capture seam — and the repeater's engines do not
//! capture, so the DCD is permanently `busy=false`. Worse than inert: every `csma_check` refusal
//! would be the 0.3 p-persistence dice, `relay_burst_at` maps it to an error, and `run_full_duplex`
//! breaks on that — measured, the FIRST unlucky roll ends the repeater. What ships instead gives
//! `engine_tx` a real capture on rig_b's own card (#1308 PR 3's `tx_device`) and reads the verdict
//! at the same `InputCapture` seam the rest of the receiver trusts.
//!
//! **Every case here asserts a REFUSAL or a deliberate non-refusal.** A test that only shows a relay
//! happening on a clear band cannot tell carrier sense from a no-op.
