//! THE #1310 PR1c GATE: the ARDOP TNC accumulates a frame ACROSS READS, and holds no stream while
//! adaptive ARQ is active.
//!
//! **What was wrong.** The worker called `engine.receive`/`receive_with_fec` in a free-running poll
//! loop. `receive` opens an input stream, reads ONCE and drops it, so on a callback backend every
//! call saw one poll interval against a frame lasting seconds — this TNC could not receive on real
//! audio at all. `LoopbackBackend::read` drains its whole buffer, so the buffer WAS the frame and
//! the defect was invisible to the suite.
//!
//! **What this proves, narrowly.** Accumulation across reads and a flush on carrier drop, with a
//! SILENT fixture. Not that the TNC receives on hardware: cpal warm-up, a live noise floor and DCD
//! calibration against real band noise are all absent, and no in-process test reaches them.
//!
//! **The adaptive case is a deliberate non-conversion, and it is gated as such.** Two receives in
//! that loop open a stream of their own through `stage_capture_input` — the ISS ARQ ACK listen and
//! the adaptive IRS arm — so holding one across them would be #1007. `enable_adaptive_arq` defaults
//! to FALSE, so what is fixed here is the shipped default; the opt-in path keeps its old one-shot
//! behaviour, and the third test pins that it holds NO stream rather than silently acquiring one.
