//! Every keyed emission on the ARDOP TNC actually keys the transmitter (#1250).
//!
//! Before this, `assert_ptt` had two call sites — the periodic station ID and the host's manual
//! `PTT TRUE` — while the ISS data path, the ARQ path, the IRS ACK/NACK and relay forwarding all
//! transmitted without touching PTT. With `ptt_backend = "rigctld"` that meant the ID keyed the rig
//! and was heard while every data burst played into an unkeyed transceiver: a silent link failure
//! whose one healthy-looking symptom pointed away from the cause.
//!
//! The scan at the bottom is the part that keeps this honest. A wrapper is only a guarantee if a bare
//! call cannot silently return, so the scan fails on any `engine.transmit*` in `bridge.rs` outside
//! the helper — and it is validated against a planted bare call, so it cannot pass vacuously.
