//! Every KISS emission keys the transmitter (#1259).
//!
//! `openpulse-kiss` declared `openpulse-radio` in its `Cargo.toml` and never used it. It built no
//! `PttController` at all, never read `[modem] ptt_backend`, and logged nothing to say so — so an
//! operator running the APRS path with `ptt_backend = "rigctld"` played audio into an unkeyed
//! transceiver. The TX counter incremented, no warning appeared, and only VOX worked. `[modem]` is
//! captioned "Modem defaults shared by all TNC binaries".
//!
//! **There is no natural positive control here.** ARDOP's equivalent test got one for free: its
//! station-ID path keyed before the fix, so a spy that never saw an assert proved the spy was
//! mis-wired rather than the code correct. KISS deliberately runs **no** `StationIdTimer` — AX.25
//! carries the source callsign in every frame's address field, which satisfies §97.119 without a
//! separate ID cycle — so nothing here keyed before. Each test therefore keys the shared PTT
//! directly first, the way `ptt_keys_every_daemon_transmit` does.
