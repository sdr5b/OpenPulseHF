//! Direct peer-to-peer file transfer protocol (`OPFX`) — pure, no-I/O state machines.
//!
//! The sender and receiver are sans-I/O state machines (the `openpulse-b2f` / `openpulse-qsy`
//! pattern): the caller feeds them decoded [`FxFrame`]s plus a millisecond clock and receives a list
//! of [`FxAction`]s to perform (transmit a frame, materialize a block, prompt the operator, verify a
//! payload, report progress, finish). Nothing here touches the filesystem, the modem, or tokio — the
//! daemon glue (`openpulse-daemon::filexfer`) performs all I/O. This keeps every protocol edge unit
//! testable with an injected clock.
//!
//! Byte-level block splitting / SAR mapping / fragment bitmaps land in `blocks.rs` (Phase B); this
//! crate (Phase A) is the wire codec, the offer + policy, and the control-flow state machines.
