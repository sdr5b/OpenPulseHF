//! The daemon never holds two capture streams open on one device.
//!
//! **The defect this pins** (loose-ends audit #917, finding #6). The daemon's receive tick holds one
//! capture stream open across ticks, because cpal is a callback backend whose buffer only fills while
//! the stream is held. An OTA `SendMessage` is handled on the *command* arm of the same `select!`, and
//! `receive_ota_ack_within` opens its **own** capture stream for the ACK window. So for the whole
//! transmit + ACK window there were two concurrent input streams on one device:
//!
//! * An exclusive ALSA `hw:` device refuses the second open outright — the ACK becomes unreceivable,
//!   and the failure surfaces as a silent peer rather than as a device conflict.
//! * The daemon's own stream is not read by anyone for that whole window (up to ~9 s per attempt,
//!   times the retry budget). `CpalInputStream`'s buffer is an unbounded `VecDeque` fed from the
//!   audio callback, so the next receive tick is handed one multi-second blob of audio captured
//!   *while this station was transmitting* — never decodable, and expensive to scan.
//!
//! A `LoopbackBackend` hides both halves: its streams are clones of a shared buffer, so a second open
//! costs nothing and nothing accumulates. That is why this was filed as cpal-only and parked. It does
//! not need real hardware to test, though — it needs a backend that *reports* what a real one does.
//! `CountingBackend` below is that: it counts concurrent input streams and records the high-water
//! mark, which is the property the fix is about.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p openpulse-daemon --no-default-features --test ota_ack_capture_stream`
