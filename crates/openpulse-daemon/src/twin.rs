//! Twin-station rig: two real `openpulse-server` daemons bridged through a
//! channel in one process, for full-stack validation and investigation.
//!
//! Both daemons run the REAL [`crate::server::run`] stack — `RateAdapter`,
//! `HpxReactor`, OTA rate-stepping, QSY, repeater — unlike `openpulse-linksim`,
//! which reimplements the policy layers. The bridge drains daemon A's modem TX
//! (loopback playback) through a forward [`ChannelModel`] into daemon B's RX
//! (loopback capture), and B's TX through a reverse model into A's RX, so bugs in
//! the real on-air paths surface here against a deterministic seeded channel.
//!
//! Each daemon binds its own control port (from `[daemon]` config), so two real
//! `openpulse-panel` instances can attach — one per station — to watch both
//! directions live. See `examples/twin_station.rs`.
