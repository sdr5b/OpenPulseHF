//! Shared, watchdog-protected PTT state (issue #863; relocated from the daemon 2026-07-19).
//!
//! The PTT controller and its max-duration deadline live behind one `Arc<Mutex<_>>` ([`SharedPtt`]) so
//! an **independent watchdog thread** ([`SharedPtt::spawn_watchdog`]) can force-release the transmitter
//! on its deadline even while a caller's single async command loop is blocked inside a long handler (a
//! QSY scan or an OTA send-retry burst) — a `select!` arm cannot, because the loop never re-enters
//! `select!` during such a handler.
//!
//! **Why it lives here.** A stuck transmitter is a §97 violation and a PA-damage risk, and it is the
//! worst outcome this system can produce. This safety core originally sat in the daemon, so the ARDOP
//! TNC, the KISS TNC and the cross-band repeater — which all key real hardware — had no watchdog at
//! all (audit 2026-07-19, findings #1–#3). It belongs beside [`PttController`], the lowest layer every
//! transmit path already depends on.
//!
//! **Lock discipline:** the mutex is only ever held for the brief duration of a hardware assert/release
//! or a deadline read/write — *never* across an RF burst — so the watchdog can acquire it and preempt at
//! any point. Poisoned locks are recovered (`into_inner`) so a panicked TX path can never wedge the
//! watchdog.
