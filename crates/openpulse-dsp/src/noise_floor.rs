//! Noise-floor estimation for the carrier detect: the noise power the block RMS sees.
//!
//! **What it estimates.** The squelch compares a block's total RMS against this floor, so the floor
//! must be the total noise power in the same samples — every frequency bin, in the proportions the
//! receive filter actually passes. Each bin's noise level is tracked separately, over time, and the
//! levels are summed (#1452).
//!
//! **Why per bin, over time.** The previous estimator took a low percentile *across* bins of the
//! 300–2700 Hz band and scaled it as if the noise were white across that band. That fails from both
//! sides: behind a narrow receive filter most of those bins are stopband, so the percentile read the
//! stopband and the squelch collapsed to its clamp (#1452); and a wideband signal filling most of the
//! band pulled the percentile up to signal level (#1304). Across time, one bin's periodogram powers
//! ARE independent draws from one exponential distribution while the noise is stationary, which is
//! the assumption the quantile correction needs; across bins they were not.
//!
//! **Why it is not poisoned by frames.** A time-domain estimate follows a long transmission up. Here
//! the caller holds the tracker while it is gathering a burst ([`NoiseFloorTracker::hold`]): the audio
//! is kept aside, and learned from only if the burst turns out to be the band rather than a
//! transmission ([`NoiseFloorTracker::commit`], a runaway-cap flush) — otherwise discarded
//! ([`NoiseFloorTracker::discard`], an ordinary carrier drop). A steady interferer that never stops
//! does end up in the floor, which is right: it is in every block's RMS too.
//!
//! It is waveform-agnostic: a noise floor is a property of the band, not of the mode received.
