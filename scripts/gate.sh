# The workspace gate. Run this instead of composing cargo invocations by hand.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Five separate times, a verdict about this repo was wrong because the CHANNEL
# carrying it was corrupted, not because the code was:
#   - `cargo test ... | tail -3` then `$?`   -> captured tail's status; a failed build reported green
#   - `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`                     -> bash-only; empty under zsh, silently
#   - `| tail -20` on a results summary      -> failures earlier in the run invisible
#   - no `--no-fail-fast`                    -> cargo stops at the first failing BINARY; the count
#                                               is a lower bound, never a total (bitten twice)
#   - "main is clean"                        -> asserted with no run behind it at all
#
# So this script bans the constructs rather than asking anyone to use them carefully:
#   * no pipelines anywhere in the verdict path — every status comes from `cmd > log 2>&1; rc=$?`,
#     the only form that is shell-dialect-free
#   * full output to a log file; the terminal gets a summary, but the FAILURE LIST IS NEVER
#     TRUNCATED, because failures are the one thing that must not be cut
#   * a machine-checkable last line (`GATE: PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL|INVALID ...`) and
#     `target/gate-verdict.json`. INVALID (exit 3) means the tree or HEAD moved during the
#     run, so the verdict is not attributable to any single state of the repo — rerun it;
#     it is NOT a code failure and must not be chased as one.
#
# SABOTAGE-VERIFY THIS SCRIPT AFTER EVERY EDIT. A gate nobody has watched fail is exactly the
# self-consistent checker it exists to prevent — this repo's archetype #1 wearing a safety vest.
#   1. plant a failing assertion in any test
#   2. run this script
#   3. require `GATE: FAIL` with that test named in the failure list
#   4. revert
# `--self-test` automates a NARROWER version of that against a scratch test file: it plants the
# fixture, runs `cargo test` DIRECTLY, and requires a non-zero status with the planted test named.
# It does not go through run_step and exits before any verdict is written, so it prints no `GATE:`
# line and writes no gate-verdict.json — the failure-detection path only. CLAUDE.md rule 3 claimed
# it "requires GATE: FAIL" until #1242; it has never printed one. A change to the VERDICT path is
# therefore invisible to it: `python3 scripts/lib/trace.py evidence-self-test` is what covers that.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gate.sh            # fmt + clippy + full workspace test
#   scripts/gate.sh --quick    # fmt + clippy only (NOT a gate; prints GATE: PARTIAL, no token)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- drift guard (#1151)
#
# WHAT THIS DETECTS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. `COMMIT` and `DIRTY` above are read once, before step 1,
# while every step resolves HEAD or scans the tree at ITS OWN step time — a ~2 h run gives HEAD and
# the tree plenty of time to move, and one real verdict already named a commit made 39 minutes in on
# a different branch. This guard samples the tree and HEAD at every step boundary and voids the run
# on a change.
#
# It catches drift that PERSISTS to a sample point. It does NOT catch a mutate-and-revert inside a
# single step: two of the incidents that motivated it were sub-second edits that would hash
# identically at both boundaries. Detecting those needs a filesystem watcher whose own liveness is
# verified — #1231. Do not write "the gate detects mid-run mutation" anywhere; it detects
# PERSISTENT mid-run mutation.
#
# The fingerprint is a temp-index `write-tree`, NOT a hash of `git status` + `git diff`. Those are
# blind to the CONTENT of untracked files — status prints `?? path` and diff prints nothing — and an
# untracked file is the likeliest mutation (the self-test's own fixture is one). The real index is
# copied first so stat-clean files reuse their cached hashes instead of re-hashing the tree. HEAD is
# compared separately: `git commit` mid-run changes no working-tree content but moves HEAD, and the
# trailer and review lints read commits.
#
# `target/` is gitignored, so the gate's own log writing does not register — verify that stays true
# if .gitignore changes, because an unignored target/ would make this fire on every run.

# The SHIPPED configuration, which the step above structurally cannot see (#1418). `--all-targets`

# must still PARSE when the feature is off, so a syntax error is caught — but nothing after parsing
# is: type errors, borrow errors, wrong arity, a renamed method. That is exactly the code most likely
# to drift, because nobody compiles it while editing something else. Precedent is not hypothetical:
# PR #424 found a build break, a clippy finding and a flaky test reachable only through the `gpu`
# feature, and this pass found two more the day it was written — a `serve`-gated test left behind
# when `LinkParams` gained two fields (uncompilable, therefore never run, for ~3 months) and a
# `float-literal-f32-fallback` in the `gui` binary that rustc says becomes a hard error.
#
# `--all-features` rather than a list of crate+feature pairs: a hand-maintained mirror of the feature
# set is the same rotting artifact this pass exists to catch. Safe because every feature here is
# ADDITIVE (`generic-serial = ["serial"]`); there is no mutually exclusive pair to break.
#
# TWO STATED LIMITS, neither closed by this pass:
#   * Not closed over TARGETS. A feature whose optional dependency is target-filtered (gpio's
#     `gpiocdev` is `[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")']`) compiles here but not elsewhere; the code
#     must carry `all(target_os = ..., feature = ...)`, as gpio.rs now does.
#   * Not closed over the SHIPPED recipe. `--all-features` turns `instruments` on, so an
#     instruments-only item called from a `cpal-backend`-gated production path passes all three
#     passes and fails only `cargo build --release -p openpulse-cli --features cpal-backend`. Zero
#     instances today; it is a residual, not a claim of completeness.
#
# The preflight is NOT ceremony: --all-features pulls alsa-sys, libudev-sys and libdbus-sys, whose
# build scripts call pkg_config and PANIC when a .pc file is absent. Without this, a missing distro
# package reads as an unintelligible build-script backtrace in the middle of clippy output.
