# The acceptance suites held out of the default workspace run because of RUNTIME, not staleness.
#
# The first two cost ~83 minutes of the ~2 h `scripts/gate.sh` between them, which is most of it. They are
# `#[ignore]`d rather than feature-gated on purpose: an ignored test still compiles and is still
# linted by `--all-targets`, so it cannot rot the way a default-off feature can.
#
# Run this before any change that touches the receiver notch, the OTA rate controller, the carrier
# detect, or the acquisition chain they exercise — and before a release. `scripts/gate.sh` does NOT
# run them.

#   scripts/slow-tests.sh             # every suite
#   scripts/slow-tests.sh notch       # just the notch acceptance suite (REQ-QRM-01)
#   scripts/slow-tests.sh ota         # just the OTA rate-adaptation suite (CAP-33)
#   scripts/slow-tests.sh spectral    # just the carrier-detect decode counts (#1454, #1443, REQ-DCD-01)
#
# Named tests, never a blanket `-- --ignored`: the notch binary also holds `probe_band_sweep`, a
# manual env-driven research harness that asserts nothing, and `capture_replay_corpus` holds two
# tests ignored for a DIFFERENT reason (#1148, stale corpus) which would fail if swept in. An
# `--ignored` run mixes gates with non-gates and produces a verdict that means nothing.
