# One-shot demo: a real-audio modem link over the two-soundcard HARDWARE loopback,
# with the operator panel showing the spectrum/waterfall captured off the cable.
# No radios, no RF — but a real cpal+ALSA audio path with two independent clocks.
#
#   openpulse CLI  --(hwloop_tx, USB card A out)--> analog cable
#       --> (hwloop_rx, USB card B in) --> openpulse-server (RX) --> panel
#
# The receive daemon binds cpal on the RX card and serves its control port; the
# panel attaches and shows the REAL captured audio (DCD energy, AFC, spectrum,
# waterfall) and the decoded frames. A separate CLI transmits modem bursts out
# the TX card, so what you watch is genuine off-the-wire signal, not a simulation.
#
# This is the hardware/dual-clock rung: unlike the all-virtual twin demo
# (scripts/demo-twin-panel.sh), the two cards have independent sample clocks and a
# real analog cable, so it exercises sample-rate offset and analog effects.
#
# Prereq: two USB soundcards cabled TX-card line-out -> RX-card mic-in, and a cpal
# build. The script runs scripts/setup-dualcard-loopback.sh for you (publishes the
# hwloop_tx / hwloop_rx PCMs). If your cards are on different USB ports, set
# TX_BYPATH / RX_BYPATH (see that script) or run it once yourself and SKIP_SETUP=1.
#
# Env overrides:
#   MODE        modulation mode (default BPSK250 — robust on the dual-clock rig)
#   INTERVAL    seconds between transmitted bursts (default 5)
#   COUNT       number of bursts, 0 = forever (default 0)
#   SIZE        random payload size in bytes (default 32)
#   TX_DEVICE   cpal output PCM (default hwloop_tx)
#   RX_DEVICE   cpal input PCM  (default hwloop_rx)
#   RX_CALLSIGN receive-daemon callsign (default HWLOOP-RX)
#   SKIP_SETUP  set to 1 to skip the dual-card ALSA setup step
#   NO_PANEL    set to 1 to skip the GUI (headless: just run the link)
